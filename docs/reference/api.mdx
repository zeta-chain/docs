# API/RPC endpoints

Below is a list of public API endpoints that can be used to interact with the
ZetaChain testnet.

<EndpointList />

## EVM RPC

ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible blockchain. EVM RPC allows you to connect to the
ZetaChain blockchain and interact with the EVM. This gives you direct access to
reading Ethereum-formatted transactions or sending them to the network

For example, querying the latest block number:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' https://rpc.ankr.com/zetachain_evm_athens_testnet
```

## Tendermint HTTP

ZetaChain is powered by the Tendermint Core BFT consensus engine. The Tendermint
HTTP API allows you to query blocks, information about validators, genesis file,
etc.

For example, querying a genesis file:

https://rpc.ankr.com/http/zetachain_tendermint_athens_testnet/genesis

## Tendermint RPC

Tendermint RPC API allows broadcasting transactions and querying the blockchain
through an JSON RPC interface.

For example, requesting a specific block:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"method": "block", "params": ["1187434"], "id": 1}' https://rpc.ankr.com/zetachain_tendermint_athens_testnet
```

## Tendermint WebSocket

Tendermint WebSocket API provides access to JSON RPC via WebSockets.

For example, connecting to the WebSocket with `wscat`

```
wscat -c wss://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/rpc/v1/public/websocket
```

## Cosmos SDK HTTP

ZetaChain is built with Cosmos SDK. Cosmos SDK HTTP API allows querying the
state of the ZetaChain blockchain and broadcast transactions.

For example, querying the latest block:

https://zetachain-testnet.nodejumper.io:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
