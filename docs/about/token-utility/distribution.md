# ZETA Distribution

The initial supply of ZETA is distributed across the following allocations. The
total initial supply of ZETA is 2,100,000,000. After approximately 4 years based
on a set curve, the protocol will plan to initiate a target of ~2.5% yearly
inflation based on the current circulating supply. ZetaChain also has a
governance model that allows for additional monetary policy to promote its goal
of long-term sustainability.

## Token Information

|                      |               |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Token Name           | ZETA          |
| Total Initial Supply | 2,100,000,000 |

## Token Distribution

| Type                    | Percentage | Total       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| User Growth Pool        | 10.00%     | 210,000,000 |
| Ecosystem Growth Fund   | 12.00%     | 252,000,000 |
| Core Contributors       | 22.50%     | 472,500,000 |
| Purchasers and Advisors | 16.00%     | 336,000,000 |
| Liquidity Incentives    | 5.50%      | 115,500,000 |
| Protocol Treasury       | 24.00%     | 504,000,000 |
| Validator Incentives    | 10.00%     | 210,000,000 |

## User Growth Pool

This portion is allocated towards incentivizing usage and growing the user-base
of ZetaChain. This will be distributed through various initiatives which are
based on active, meaningful user behaviors. For example, this portion will be
used for programs like the ZetaLabs airdrop, wallet campaigns, and other
community-focused rewards to raise awareness of ZetaChain utility features and
usage thereof.

## Ecosystem Growth Fund

This portion is allocated towards partners and developers contributing to the
ZetaChain ecosystem. For example, incentives to help dApp developers get started
through a grant program or for wallet partners to support ZetaChain natively.

## Protocol Treasury

The treasury pool is allocated towards ecosystem and community initiatives aimed
at improving the ZetaChain ecosystem such as network insurance, bug bounties,
protocol development and bounties, and operations.

## Liquidity Incentives

The assets managed by the network's TSS have an allocation of rewards that
incentivize providing liquidity that is usable on zEVM. This portion is
allocated towards incentivizing liquidity that is crucial for the protocol and
ecosystem to function and maintain stability, in order to facilitate
low-slippage and minimal gas-usage transfers of value through and on ZetaChain.

To incentivize liquidity in pools such as the Core ZRC-20 pools, this pool will
be used to provide on-chain incentives for them to help bootstrap a seamless
transaction experience for users and developers.

## Core Contributors, Advisors, and Purchasers

ZETA are allocated to Purchasers as well as Core Contributors and Advisors who
earned tokens for their contributions to the ZetaChain network.

## Validator Incentives

A portion of the total initial supply (10%) is allocated to the initial
emissions pool on ZetaChain. This pool allows for block rewards targeted to
sustain and secure the network over the first 4 years of network growth. After
this pools is depleted, the protocol will introduce a planned 2.5% inflation
through validator rewards, separate from the emission curve. You can read more
