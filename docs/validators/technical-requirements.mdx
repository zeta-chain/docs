# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the process for hosting a ZetaChain node. It is intended
for those who are familiar with the Linux operating system and the command line
interface.

## Technical Requirements

### Node Specifications

These are some recommended specs to run the different type of ZetaChain nodes.

| Type                       | CPU    | Memory       | Storage           |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Validator                  | 4 CPUs | 32 GB Memory | 350 GB Disk Space |
| API Node                   | 4 CPUs | 32 GB Memory | 350 GB Disk Space |
| Full Node / Statesync Node | 4 CPUs | 32 GB Memory | 350 GB Disk Space |
| Archive Node               | 4 CPUs | 32 GB Memory | 500 GB Disk Space |

\*Archive nodes store the entire blockchain. As the blockchain grows, more disk
space is needed.

The cost of running nodes varies depending on the provider and the terms. As an
example, an estimated cost for running an r6i.xlarge instance on AWS can be
found here:

### Operating System

ZetaChain nodes have been developed and tested on x86_64 architecture. Our
binary files have been compiled with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. This guide assumes
you are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. If you are using a different OS you may
need to make some adjustments.
