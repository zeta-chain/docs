# Creating a Core Validator

This guide assumes your have already created and synced up your node using the
[Node Setup Guide](/validators/running-a-full-node).

This guide is design for simplicity and does not cover the intricacies of secure
key management. We recommend you follow best practices when it comes to secure
key generation and key management. We are unable to offer support outside of the
basic setup of a ZetaChain validator.

### Create a Validator Account

Create the account `operator`.

Make sure to store the mnemonic from the output in a safe place. You will need
this information to later access your account.

```bash
zetacored keys add operator --algo secp256k1
```

### Add Funds to the Validator Account

Check your validator account balance. It’s newly created so `balances` should be
empty.

```bash
zetacored query bank balances $(zetacored keys show operator -a)
```

Add funds to your validator account.

Send tokens from your own wallet or from an exchange to your validators address.
Make sure you are sending them using the zetachain cosmos based network, not the
zEVM network.

Check your validator account funds `balances`.

```bash
zetacored query bank balances $(zetacored keys show operator -a)
```

### Create Your Validator

Create a new validator by staking **_azeta_** tokens. Here is an example of
creating a validator on Zetachain Testnet. Save the transaction hash from the
output.

```bash
zetacored tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000000000000000azeta \
  --pubkey=$(zetacored tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="MY_NODE_NAME" \
  --chain-id=athens_7001-1 \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-adjustment=1.15 \
  --gas-prices="0.1azeta" \
  --from=operator
```

---

- `amount` is the amount of tokens to be bonded
- `moniker` is the validator's name
- `commission-rate` is the commission rate on block rewards and fees charged to
  delegators
- `commission-max-rate` is the maximum commission rate that this validator can
  charge. This parameter is fixed and cannot be changed after the validator is
  created
- `commission-max-change-rate` is the maximum daily increase of the validator
  commission. This parameter is fixed cannot be changed after the validator is
  created
- `min-self-delegation` is the minimum amount of **azeta** the validator
  requires to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-delegated stake
  falls below this limit, the validator gets jailed and kicked out of the active
  validator set
- `gas-prices` is gas prices in decimal format to determine the transaction fee
- When specifying commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is
  used to measure % *point* change over the `commission-rate`. E.g. 1% to 2% is
  a 100% rate increase, but only 1 percentage point
- `min-self-delegation` is a strictly positive integer that represents the
  minimum amount of self-delegated voting power your validator must always have

### Check Transaction Status

Check the log of the transaction hash that created your validator and make sure
there are no errors. If there are errors, your validator creation failed and you
will need to troubleshoot it.

```bash
zetacored query tx <your transaction hash>
```

### Check Validator Status

To confirm your validator is created, run this command which shows the current
status of your validator.

```bash
zetacored query staking validator $(zetacored keys show operator --bech operator -a)
```

It's possible that you don’t have enough **_azeta_** tokens to be part of the
active set of validators in the beginning. If the status is unbonded
`status: BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED`, you didn’t stake enough tokens `amount` when you
created your validator.

In this case, your validator is not in the active set. It cannot sign blocks and
it does not earn rewards. It can however, receive delegations.

To delegate additional tokens to your validator use the following command.
Adjust the amount of tokens accordingly to reach the minimum required bonded
tokens.

```bash
zetacored tx staking delegate $(zetacored keys show operator --bech operator -a) 1000000azeta --from operator
```

Once your validator receives sufficient bonded tokens it automatically join the
active set and its status is updated to `status: BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.

### **Confirm Your Validator is Running**

Once your validator is bonded, you can check if it is in the validator set by
executing the following command and it should return your validator address.

```bash
zetacored query tendermint-validator-set | grep $(zetacored tendermint show-address)
```

You can also check the validator signing information using the following command
and verify that `missed_blocks_counter: "0”` and `index_offset:` is increasing.

```bash
zetacored query slashing signing-info $(zetacored tendermint show-validator)
```

### Unjail Your Validator

If your validator falls out-of-sync with the chain (downtime), it can be
“jailed”. Check your validator status for `jailed: true`. Once your validator is
back in sync with the chain (it is at same block height as the validators in the
active set), it can be “unjailed” `jailed: false` with the following command.

```bash
zetacored tx slashing unjail --from=operator
```

Check the transaction status for any error and confirm that your validator is
part of the active set again with the command in the previous section.
