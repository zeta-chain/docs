# Bounty Guidelines

- A contributor will be assigned based on the implementation plan they provided and their previous experience
- To claim a bounty, you need to **provide a short demo video** of your changes in your pull request
- If anything is unclear, **ask for clarification** before starting as this will help avoid potential rework
- Low quality AI PRs will not receive review and will be closed
- Do not begin work until you are assigned to the issue. Only the assigned contributor is eligible to submit a pull request and receive the bounty. This helps prevent duplicate work.
- If a PR from the assigned contributor does not meet the requirements, the issue may be reassigned to another contributor.
