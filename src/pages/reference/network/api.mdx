## Private endpoints

If you are a developer we highly recommend signing up for a free private
endpoint through [AllThatNode](https://www.allthatnode.com/zetachain.dsrv),
[BlockPI](https://blockpi.io/zeta), [InfStones](https://infstones.com/fast-api),
[Blast API](https://blastapi.io/chains/zetachain),
[dRPC](https://drpc.org/chainlist/zeta-chain),
[Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/zetachain), or another RPC provider. The
private endpoints have higher throughput, less restrictions, and will provide a
more consistent experience than the public RPCs.

## Public endpoints

Below is a list of public API endpoints that can be used to interact with
ZetaChain from wallet software or web application frontend. Public endpoints are
not to be used for backend services or high traffic applications.

## EVM RPC

ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible blockchain. EVM RPC allows you to connect to the
ZetaChain blockchain and interact with the EVM. This gives you direct access to
reading Ethereum-formatted transactions or sending them to the network

For example, querying the latest block number:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' https://zetachain-athens-evm.blockpi.network/v1/rpc/public
```

## Tendermint HTTP

ZetaChain is powered by the Tendermint Core BFT consensus engine. The Tendermint
HTTP API allows you to query blocks, information about validators, genesis file,
etc.

For example, querying a genesis file:

https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/rpc/v1/public/genesis

## Tendermint RPC

Tendermint RPC API allows broadcasting transactions and querying the blockchain
through an JSON RPC interface.

For example, requesting a specific block:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"method": "block", "params": ["3336883"], "id": 1}' https://rpc.ankr.com/zetachain_tendermint_athens_testnet
```

## Tendermint WebSocket

Tendermint WebSocket API provides access to JSON RPC via WebSockets.

For example, connecting to the WebSocket with `wscat`

```
wscat -c wss://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/rpc/v1/public/websocket
```

## Cosmos SDK HTTP

ZetaChain is built with Cosmos SDK. Cosmos SDK HTTP API allows querying the
state of the ZetaChain blockchain and broadcast transactions.

For example, querying the latest block:

https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public//cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
