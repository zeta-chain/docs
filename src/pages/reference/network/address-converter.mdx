import { AddressConverter } from "~/components/Docs";

To convert between bech32 and EVM addresses, you can use the following tool:

<AddressConverter />

Converting between bech32 and EVM addresses is an off-chain operation and can be
implemented in any programming language, for example, [in
TypeScript](https://github.com/zeta-chain/docs/blob/main/src/components/Docs/components/AddressConverter/AddressConverter.utils.ts).
On the CLI you can also use [`zetacored debug
addr`](/developers/architecture/zetacored/cli/#zetacored-debug-addr) command.
