# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to
securely connect to external tools and data sources through local or remote
servers.

The ZetaChain MCP server extends your AI coding environment, such as Cursor or
Claude Code, with direct access to on-chain data and CLI-powered actions. This
means you can query balances, estimate cross-chain fees, execute contract calls,
and track transactions across chains, all without leaving your editor or chat
interface.

## Install the ZetaChain CLI

Install the latest version of the ZetaChain CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g zetachain@latest
```

This includes everything needed to run the MCP server locally (recommended for
best performance and security).

Note: MCP support is available starting in `zetachain` v7.1.1. Check your
version:

```bash
zetachain --version
```

If your version is older than v7.1.1, update to the latest release:

```bash
npm install -g zetachain@latest
```

## Connect MCP to Cursor or Claude Code

Install the ZetaChain MCP integration for your preferred AI client:

```bash
zetachain mcp install --client cursor
# or
zetachain mcp install --client claude
```

Once installed, your AI tool will be able to access ZetaChain data and perform
on-chain operations directly through the MCP interface.

Note: The `--client claude` option refers to the Claude Code client. Claude
Desktop is not currently supported.

## Verify Installation

List all available MCP integrations to confirm that ZetaChain is active:

```bash
zetachain mcp list
```

You should see an entry for the ZetaChain MCP server.

## Test the Integration

After verifying installation, try a simple prompt in your AI editor:

> “Query all chains connected to ZetaChain.”

Your editor should automatically run:

```bash
zetachain query chains
```

and display a table of all connected chains. If you see this output, the
ZetaChain MCP server is working correctly.

## Remove the Integration

If you ever need to remove the MCP integration:

```bash
zetachain mcp remove --client cursor
# or
zetachain mcp remove --client claude
```

## Alternative: Run via Smithery

If you don’t want to run the MCP server locally, you can use the hosted version
on Smithery. This is ideal for quick trials or environments where local setup
isn’t possible.
