title: "Faucet: Get Testnet Tokens"
---

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain. For
ZetaChain's testnet network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected
testnet networks. With ZetaChain's mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and
transacted across all connected chains.

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

## Getting Testnet Assets

If you need more gas assets for the respective testnet networks to transact
with, you can try the following faucets:
