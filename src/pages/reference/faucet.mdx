title: "Faucet: Get Testnet ZETA"
---

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain, and to
transact data and value across chains (through messaging). For ZetaChain's
testnet network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected testnet
networks. With ZetaChain's mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and transacted
across all connected chains.

You can view the addresses on respective chains
[here](/reference/network/contracts). Check out [Omnichain Smart
Contacts](/start/app) for more information about developing smart contracts on
ZetaChain, where ZETA is used for gas fees.

## How to get testnet ZETA

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

To obtain testnet ZETA for development purposes, please follow the instructions
provided below.

### Using the ZetaChain CLI faucet

The easiest way to get testnet ZETA is to use the ZetaChain CLI faucet. You can
install the CLI by following the instructions (you may need `sudo` privileges):

```
npm install -g zetachain
```

Once installed, you can use the faucet to get ZETA tokens on ZetaChain:

```
zetachain faucet --address 0x4bB9089ee3B86e97b171838205483362966f9dE8
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your GitHub account to use the faucet.

Please note that using this faucet you can get only ZETA tokens on ZetaChain.

If you need gas assets on connected chains (like Bitcoin, Sepolia, Mumbai or BSC
testnet), you can use the other faucets listed below.

### Using the Google Cloud Web3 Faucet

Google Cloud Web3 Faucet allows you to quickly receive testnet tokens directly
in your ZetaChain wallet. Simply choose ZetaChain as the network, enter your
wallet address, and the faucet will automatically send a small amount of tokens
to your account. Note that to ensure fair distribution, there is a rate limit
per Google account and wallet address.

## Getting Additional Testnet Gas Assets

If you need more gas assets for the respective testnet networks to transact
with, you can try the following faucets:
