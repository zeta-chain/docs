## Overview

ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible Cosmos SDK-based blockchain that features
interoperability with Bitcoin. This means that many EVM and Cosmos wallets can
be used to sign transactions and interact with ZetaChain.

To interact with ZetaChain from connected chains, and to interact with ZetaChain
directly, we recommend using an EVM wallet.

## EVM Wallets

We suggest the following wallets (although there are plenty of alternatives!):

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

To add ZetaChain to your wallet, use the information on the [Networks Details
page](/reference/network/details).

## Bitcoin Wallets

In order to interact with ZetaChain from Bitcoin, you'll need a wallet that
meets certain criteria. You can learn more about it in the [Bitcoin
section](/developers/chains/bitcoin) of the docs.

Supported wallets:

- [XDEFI](https://www.xdefi.io/)
- [OKX](https://www.okx.com/web3)
- [UniSat](https://unisat.io/)
- [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/)

Other wallets may also work, but the above wallets have been specifically tested
for compatibility.

## Cosmos Wallets

Cosmos wallets can be used to transfer native tokens on ZetaChain. They can also
be used to sign ZetaChain's EVM transactions if the dapp is configured to use a
Cosmos wallet. We recommend using a Cosmos wallet if you're interacting with the
Cosmos side of ZetaChain: native token transfers, governance, groups, staking
tokens, authz.

### Keplr

[Keplr](https://keplr.app/) is a popular extension and mobile wallet for
Cosmos-based chains. It can be used to interact with ZetaChain.

Add ZetaChain to the Keplr browser extension: https://chains.keplr.app/.

### Leap

[Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/) is an extension and mobile wallet for
Cosmos-based chains. Leap lets users view balances, transaction history, send
tokens between accounts, view and vote on governance proposals, view
delegations, and delegate to validators.

Add ZetaChain to the Leap browser extension:
https://developers.leapwallet.io/chain-store.
