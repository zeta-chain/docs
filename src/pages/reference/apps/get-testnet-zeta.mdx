title: Get Testnet ZETA (faucet)
---

## What is ZETA?

ZETA is a token used to deploy and call smart contracts on ZetaChain, and to
transact data and value across chains (through messaging). For ZetaChain's
testnet network, they use the same ZETA that lives on connected testnet
networks. With ZetaChain's mainnet launch, ZETA will be traded and transacted
across all connected chains.

You can view the addresses on respective chains
[here](/reference/network/contracts). Check out [Omnichain Smart
Contacts](/developers/apps/intro) for more information about developing smart
contracts on ZetaChain, where ZETA is used for gas fees.

## How to get testnet ZETA

Please note that testnet ZETA has no monetary value and is solely intended for
testing and development purposes. Therefore, if you're not a developer, there's
no need for you to acquire testnet ZETA.

To obtain testnet ZETA for development purposes, please follow the instructions
provided below.

### Using the ZetaChain CLI faucet

The easiest way to get testnet ZETA is to use the ZetaChain CLI faucet. You can
install the CLI by following the instructions (you may need `sudo` privileges):

```
npm install -g @zetachain/faucet-cli
```

Once installed, you can use the faucet to get ZETA tokens on ZetaChain:

```
zetafaucet --drip --address 0x4bB9089ee3B86e97b171838205483362966f9dE8
```

You will be prompted to authenticate with your GitHub account to use the faucet.

Please note that using this faucet you can get only ZETA tokens on ZetaChain. If
you want to transfer ZETA tokens between connected chain or to/from ZetaChain,
use the built-in `send-zeta` command.

If you need gas assets on connected chains (like Bitcoin, Sepolia, Mumbai or BSC
testnet), you can use the other faucets listed below.

### Swapping Native Gas Assets for ZETA

If you already have some native gas assets on the respective testnet networks,
you can swap them for ZETA tokens using Uniswap on Sepolia and Mumbai and
Pancake Swap on BSC testnet.

For example, to swap sETH for ZETA do the following:

- Go to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
- Press "Connect" to connect your wallet
- Switch to the **Sepolia testnet** in your wallet (please, make sure you're on
  the testnet network before proceeding)
- Select ETH as the input token
- Press "Select token"
- Add ZETA token by pasting the `zetaToken` contract address from the [testnet
  addresses](/reference/network/contracts) page into the input field
- Enter amount and press "Swap"

Optionally, import `zetaToken` contract address into your wallet to see your
ZETA balance.

After receiving ZETA tokens on Sepolia, you can either switch to another testnet
network (like Mumbai or BSC testnet) to swap ZETA there, or use the built-in
`send-zeta` command to transfer ZETA between connected networks.

### Using a Hardhat template

If you're using [a Hardhat template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template),
you can get ZETA tokens by running the following command:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```

Under the hood this command uses the ZetaChain CLI faucet.

### Using the Faucet on Discord

You can also get testnet ZETA on the [ZetaChain Discord
server](https://discord.com/invite/zetachain). To do so, please follow the
instructions provided in the `#zeta-faucet-athens-3` channel.

with, you can try the following faucets:
