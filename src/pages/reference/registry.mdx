title: Contract Registry
description: Discover and query protocol contract addresses across chains using ZetaChain's on-chain registry.
---

## What you can do

The Contract Registry is the single source of truth for protocol contract
addresses, ZRC-20 tokens, and chain configuration used by ZetaChain and all
connected chains. You can use it to find canonical addresses for system
contracts like `gateway`, `erc20Custody`, ZRC-20, and more

## Address

The Contract Registry is deployed on ZetaChain under the same address on
mainnet, testnet and localnet:

```bash
0x7CCE3Eb018bf23e1FE2a32692f2C77592D110394
```

## Query with the ZetaChain CLI

List all registered contracts:

```bash
zetachain query contracts list
```

Get a specific contract by type and chain ID (example: Ethereum Sepolia
`11155111` gateway):

```bash
zetachain query contracts show --type gateway --chain-id 11155111
```

## Use from universal contracts

The registry returns whether an entry is active and an ABI-encoded payload you
can decode.

Read the Gateway address on Ethereum Sepolia (chain ID `11155111`):

```solidity
(bool active, bytes memory gatewayAddressBytes) = registry.getContractInfo(11155111, "gateway");
address gateway = address(uint160(bytes20(gatewayAddressBytes)));
```

Read Uniswap V2 Router on ZetaChain testnet (chain ID `7001`):

```solidity
(bool active, bytes memory uniswapRouterBytes) = registry.getContractInfo(7001, "uniswapV2Router02");
address uniswapRouter = address(uint160(bytes20(uniswapRouterBytes)));
```
