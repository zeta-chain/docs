title: Creating a Core Validator

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

## Overview

<Alert variant="note">
  {" "}
  This guide assumes you've completed the [Setting Up Your Node](/nodes/start-here/setup) step and synced the node using
  of the provided options.{" "}
</Alert>

This guide is design for simplicity and does not cover the intricacies of secure
key management. We recommend you follow best practices when it comes to secure
key generation and key management. We are unable to offer support outside of the
basic setup of a ZetaChain validator.

This guide should be run as the account under which your validator will be running. If you have completed our node setup documentation, the command to switch to that user is:
```bash
sudo su -l zetachain
```

### Create a Validator Account

Create the account `operator`.

Make sure to store the mnemonic from the output in a safe place. You will need
this information to later access your account.

```bash
zetacored keys add operator --algo secp256k1
```

### Add Funds to the Validator Account

Check your validator account balance. It’s newly created so `balances` should be
empty.

```bash
zetacored query bank balances $(zetacored keys show operator -a)
```

Add funds to your validator account.

Send tokens from your own wallet or from an exchange to your validators address.
Make sure you are sending them using the ZetaChain's Cosmos based network, not
the ZetaChain's EVM network.

Check your validator account funds `balances`.

```bash
zetacored query bank balances $(zetacored keys show operator -a)
```

### Create Your Validator

Create a new validator by staking **_azeta_** tokens. Here is an example of
creating a validator on the Zetachain Mainnet Beta network. Save the transaction 
hash from the output.

First, create and adjust as needed a ~/validator.json file, copying the template below. Be sure to update all fields with appropriate values:
```text
{
	"pubkey": {"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey","key":"EXAMPLE+F405Jcm2vXV+2v4fnjodh6aafuIdeoW+rUw="},
	"amount": "1000000000000000000azeta",
	"moniker": "myvalidator",
	"identity": "validator's (optional) identity signature (ex. UPort or Keybase)",
	"website": "validator's (optional) website",
	"security": "validator's (optional) security contact email",
	"details": "validator's (optional) details",
	"commission-rate": "0.1",
	"commission-max-rate": "0.2",
	"commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
	"min-self-delegation": "1000000"
}
```
- `amount` is the amount of tokens to be bonded
- `moniker` is the validator's name
- `commission-rate` is the commission rate on block rewards and fees charged to
  delegators
- `commission-max-rate` is the maximum commission rate that this validator can
  charge. This parameter is fixed and cannot be changed after the validator is
  created
- `commission-max-change-rate` is the maximum daily increase of the validator
  commission. This parameter is fixed cannot be changed after the validator is
  created
- `min-self-delegation` is the minimum amount of **azeta** the validator
  requires to have bonded at all time. If the validator's self-delegated stake
  falls below this limit, the validator gets jailed and kicked out of the active
  validator set
- When specifying commission parameters, the `commission-max-change-rate` is
  used to measure % *point* change over the `commission-rate`. E.g. 1% to 2% is
  a 100% rate increase, but only 1 percentage point
- `min-self-delegation` is a strictly positive integer that represents the
  minimum amount of self-delegated voting power your validator must always have

Next, ensure that you have replaced the validator's pubkey in validator.json with the output from this command: `zetacored tendermint show-validator`.

Finally, create and execute your validator creation transaction, capturing the txhash from the output. 
```bash
zetacored tx staking create-validator ~/validator.json \
  --gas=10000000 \
  --gas-prices=10000000000azeta \
  --from=operator
```

### Check Transaction Status

Check the log of the transaction hash that created your validator and make sure
there are no errors. If there are errors, your validator creation failed and you
will need to troubleshoot it.

```bash
zetacored query tx <your transaction hash>
```

### Check Validator Status

To confirm your validator is created, run this command which shows the current
status of your validator.

```bash
zetacored query staking validator $(zetacored keys show operator --bech val -a)
```

It’s possible that you don’t have enough **_azeta_** tokens to be part of the
active set of validators in the beginning. If the status is unbonded `status: BOND_STATUS_UNBONDED`, you didn’t stake enough tokens `amount` when you created
your validator.

In this case, your validator is not in the active set. It cannot sign blocks and
it does not earn rewards. It can however, receive delegations.

To delegate additional tokens to your validator use the following command.
Adjust the amount of tokens accordingly to reach the minimum required bonded
tokens. Your validator must have enough tokens to be in the top 100 validators 
by voting power. As of early Q1 2025, this requires a minimum of 700 ZETA.

```bash
zetacored tx staking delegate $(zetacored keys show operator --bech val -a) 2000000azeta \
--gas=10000000 --gas-prices=10000000000azeta  --from operator
```

Once your validator receives sufficient bonded tokens it automatically join the
active set and its status is updated to `status: BOND_STATUS_BONDED`.

### **Confirm Your Validator is Running**

Once your validator is bonded, you can check if it is in the validator set by
executing the following command and it should return your validator address.

```bash
zetacored query tendermint-validator-set | grep $(zetacored tendermint show-address)
```

You can also check the validator signing information using the following command
and verify that `missed_blocks_counter: "0”` and `index_offset:` is increasing.

```bash
zetacored query slashing signing-info $(zetacored tendermint show-validator)
```
### Backup Your Validator's Concensus Key

By default, the validator's consensus key exists only on the validator node itself. 
It is important to maintain a backup of this key to protect yourself from losing control 
of your validator in the event of unexpected data loss. Please ensure that you create a 
backup copy of the `~/.zetacored/config/priv_validator_key.json` file, and securely save 
in another location other than the node itself.

### Unjail Your Validator

If your validator falls out-of-sync with the chain (downtime), it can be
“jailed”. Check your validator status for `jailed: true`. Once your validator is
back in sync with the chain (it is at same block height as the validators in the
active set), it can be “unjailed” `jailed: false` with the following command.

```bash
zetacored tx slashing unjail --from=operator
```

Check the transaction status for any error and confirm that your validator is
part of the active set again with the command in the previous section.

### Withdrawing Funds

You can withdraw rewards including comissions using this command. 

```bash
zetacored tx distribution withdraw-rewards --commission [validator_address]
```

Optionally, you can set up different address to receive your payouts 
instead of rewards being sent directly to the validator's wallet address. 

```bash
zetacored tx distribution set-withdraw-addr [withdraw-addr]
```
