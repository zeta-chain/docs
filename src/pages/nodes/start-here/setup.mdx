title: Setting Up a Node
description: In this guide we will be setting up a ZetaChain Mainnet node. For a testnet node, follow the same instructions, but replace some values (like chain ID and seed nodes) with the ones provided in corresponding tables.

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

## Install the ZetaChain Node Binary

First, download the binary and give it executable permissions. Make sure to
replace the `VERSION` with the latest version passed in a
[governance software upgrade proposal](/reference/network/proposals) and the platform
(`-linux-amd64`) with the one you need.

```
wget https://github.com/zeta-chain/node/releases/download/VERSION/zetacored-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/zetacored

chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/zetacored
```

Check out the GitHub for
[more information on releases](https://github.com/zeta-chain/node/releases).

Check that you have the correct version of `zetacored` installed:

```
zetacored version
```

## Initialize the Data Directory

| Network      | Chain ID         |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Mainnet      | zetachain_7000-1 |
| Testnet      | athens_7001-1    |

```
zetacored init MONIKER --chain-id zetachain_7000-1
```

Replace `MONIKER` with a name for your node. By default the node will be
initialized in `$HOME/.zetacored`, but you can customize this with the `--home`
flag.

## Fetch Config Files

| Network      | Config Files                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet      | https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-config/tree/main/mainnet |
| Testnet      | https://github.com/zeta-chain/network-config/tree/main/athens3 |

Fetch and save config files in the data directory:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/genesis.json -O ~/.zetacored/config/genesis.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/client.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/client.toml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/config.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/config.toml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/network-config/main/mainnet/app.toml -O ~/.zetacored/config/app.toml
```

## Modify the Config Files

Even though the config files you fetched in the previous step already contain
all the required values common for all nodes, you will need to make some
adjustments specific to your node.

If your machine has an external IPv4 address you can get it by running the
command in your terminal:

```
curl -4 icanhazip.com

109.68.188.70
```

If you have an IPv6 address, you can use that as an external address.

Replace the moniker and external address with correct values.

```text filename="~/.zetacored/config/config.toml"
moniker = "{MONIKER}"
external_address = "{YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP_ADDRESS_HERE}:26656"
```

## Set Limits on Open Files and Number of Processes

To better manage the resources of your nodes, we recommend setting some limits
on the maximum number of open file descriptors (nofile) and maximum number of
processes (nproc).

Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf` to include or modify the following parameters:

```
*       soft    nproc   262144
*       hard    nproc   262144
*       soft    nofile  262144
*       hard    nofile  262144
```

Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include the following:

```
fs.file-max=262144
```

## Installing Cosmovisor

From the [cosmos docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/tooling/cosmovisor):

> cosmovisor is a process manager for Cosmos SDK application binaries that automates application binary switch at chain upgrades. It polls the upgrade-info.json file that is created by the x/upgrade module at upgrade height, and then can automatically download the new binary, stop the current binary, switch from the old binary to the new one, and finally restart the node with the new binary.

### From Source

```bash
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.5.0
mv $(go env GOPATH)/bin/cosmovisor /usr/local/bin/cosmovisor
```

### From Precompiled Binaries

Download the correct binary from the [cosmovisor v1.5.0 release](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0). For example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/download/cosmovisor%2Fv1.5.0/cosmovisor-v1.5.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar xf cosmovisor-v1.5.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz
mv cosmovisor /usr/local/bin
```

## Setting Up Cosmovisor

### Create `cosmovisor` Directories

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/genesis/bin
mkdir -p ~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/upgrades
```

### Install the Current `zetacored` Binary

Find the current `zetacored` binary as specific in [setup](./setup). Place it in `~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/genesis/bin` rather than `$PATH`.

## Configure `zetacored` systemd service

### Create Non-Root User Account

We recommend running ZetaChain binary files with a user account rather than as
root.

```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash zetachain
```

## Create ZetaChain Directory Structure

This is needed to store ZetaChain binary and configuration files.

```bash
sudo su zetachain
mkdir /home/zetachain/.zetacored/config
```

### Configure a Systemd Unit File

Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/zetacored.service` with the following contents:

```
[Unit]
Description=zetacored (running under cosmovisor)
After=multi-user.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/zetachain/.zetacored/cosmovisor
Environment="DAEMON_HOME=/home/zetachain/.zetacored"
Environment="DAEMON_NAME=zetacored"
Environment="DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true"
Environment="DAEMON_RESTART_AFTER_UPGRADE=true"
Environment="DAEMON_DATA_BACKUP_DIR=/home/zetachain/.zetacored"
Environment="CLIENT_DAEMON_NAME=zetaclientd"
Environment="CLIENT_SKIP_UPGRADE=false"
Environment="CLIENT_START_PROCESS=false"
Environment="UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true"
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=600
User=zetachain
LimitNOFILE=262144
ExecStart=cosmovisor run start --home /home/zetachain/.zetacored/ --log_format json  --moniker <YOUR_NODE_NAME_HERE>
```

<Alert variant="danger">
    In this example, we have set `DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true`. This instructs `cosmovisor` to automatically 
    download the new binaries specified in the upgrade proposal. This would fail if the Github API is down.

    We suggest keeping this feature enabled, but preloading and validating any new binaries before the upgrade to
    minimize risk. If you have already preloaded the binaries, none will be downloaded.

    Read more about [cosmovisor Auto-Download here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/build/tooling/cosmovisor#auto-download).

</Alert>

Run `systemctl daemon-reload` to load the service.

Run `systemctl enable --now zetacored` to start the service and to automatically start it at boot.

## Upgrades

Follow the [#testnet-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/858516330432299008/1088945250124435486) and/or
[#mainnet-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/858516330432299008/1210655572798476338) channels on discord to receive
upgrade proposal notifications.

Download the new binaries from the github release and install them into the cosmovisor upgrade directory.
The name of the directory must match the upgrade name. The upgrade name is **not** the the release name on github. Reference
the [Governance Upgrade Proposals](./proposals) page to easily see the upgrade names. Here are some examples:

| Upgrade Name | `zetacored` Path                                            | git tag   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `v17-athens` | `~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/upgrades/v17-athens/bin/zetacored` | `v17.0.0` |
| `v17`        | `~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/upgrades/v17/bin/zetacored`        | `v17.0.0` |
| `v16`        | `~/.zetacored/cosmovisor/upgrades/v16/bin/zetacored`        | `v16.0.0` |

After installing the binary, you should:

- validate the checksum is correct
- run `zetacored version` to validate that you can actually run the downloaded binary

## Monitoring

In a production environment we recommend monitoring the node resources (CPU
load, Memory Usage, Disk usage and Disk IO) for any performance degradation.

`zetacored` generates logs that can be monitored for errors and used for
troubleshooting. If you install `zetacored` as a Systemd service using the
instructions above you can view logs with
`journalctl -f -u zetacored`.

### Metrics

Prometheus can be enabled to serve metrics which can be consumed by Prometheus
collector(s). Telemetry include Prometheus metrics can be enabled in the
app.toml file. See the
[Cosmos SDK Telemetry Documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/core/telemetry.html)
for more information.

#### Enable Prometheus Metrics

To enable metrics, you'll have to make an adjustment in the node's `config.toml`
file by setting the `prometheus` option to `true`:

```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' /home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/config.toml
```

To apply the modification, it’s necessary to restart the node. You should then
have the capability to reach the `tendermint` metrics, which are set as the
default on port port **26660**: [http://localhost:26660](http://localhost:26660)
