## Node Specifications

These are the recommended specs for a ZetaChain node.

| Node Type       | CPU    | Memory       | Data Disk         |
| :-------------- | :----- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| Core Validator  | 4 CPUs | 16 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |
| Full Node       | 4 CPUs | 12 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |
| Archive         | 4 CPUs | 12 GB Memory | 3+ TB Data Disk   |

It is recommended to run validators on a machine with NVMe SSDs that support
high IOPS (12K or higher) to avoid falling behind and getting the validator jailed.

## Network Requirements

#### Public Ports

ZetaChain nodes communicate over the following ports. Make sure these are open
to the public internet.

| Node Type               | Port  | Protocol |
| :---------------------- | :---- | :------- |
| Full Node and Validator | 26656 | TCP      |

#### RPC/API/Archive Nodes

If you want to access RPC/API services on your node you'll need to make sure the
following ports are open.

| RPC Type       | Port  | Protocol |
| :------------- | :---  | :------- |
| Tendermint     | 26657 | TCP      |
| EVM RPC - HTTP | 8545  | TCP      |
| EVM RPC - WSS  | 8546  | TCP      |
| Cosmos RPC     | 1317  | TCP      |

#### Operating System

ZetaChain nodes have been developed and tested on x86_64 architecture. Our
binary files have been compiled with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. This guide assumes
you are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. If you are using a different OS you may
need to make some adjustments.

## Infrastructure Cost Analysis

Understanding the costs associated with running a ZetaChain node is crucial for planning your deployment. Below is a comprehensive cost breakdown for different hosting options.

### Monthly Cost Comparison

#### Cloud Providers

| Provider | Instance Type | Compute | Storage | Total Base | With Bandwidth* |
| :------- | :------------ | :------ | :------ | :--------- | :-------------- |
| **AWS** | t3.xlarge | $121.47 | $24.00 | $145.47 | $235-595 |
| **AWS** | m5.xlarge | $140.00 | $24.00 | $164.00 | $254-614 |
| **AWS** | Reserved (1yr) | $85.00 | $24.00 | $109.00 | $199-559 |
| **GCP** | n2-standard-4 | $141.79 | $51.00 | $192.79 | $271-754 |

*Bandwidth costs vary significantly based on data transfer (1-5 TB/month estimated)

#### Bare Metal/Dedicated Servers

| Provider        | Configuration                  | Monthly Cost     | Notes                                         |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Hetzner**     | 4-core, 32GB RAM, NVMe SSD      | €54.99 (~$60)    | Unmetered on 1 Gbps port; FUP may apply         |
| **OVHcloud**    | 4-core, 16GB RAM, NVMe/1TB SSD   | €43.99 (~$48)    | Unmetered on 1 Gbps port; FUP may apply         |
| **Vultr**       | 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 300GB NVMe     | $180.00          | Good performance; check port speed cap          |
| **Cherry Servers** | 4-core, 32GB RAM, 240GB SSD   | $120.00          | Enterprise grade                                |
| **InMotion Hosting** | 4-core, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD  | $69.99           | Budget option                                   |
### Annual Cost Summary

| Provider Type | Low End | High End | Best For |
| :------------ | :------ | :------- | :------- |
| **Bare Metal** | $576 | $2,160 | Cost optimization |
| **AWS Reserved** | $2,388 | $6,708 | Enterprise/Production |
| **GCP Optimized** | $2,772 | $7,608 | Google ecosystem |

### Additional Costs to Consider

#### Bandwidth Requirements
ZetaChain validators require significant bandwidth for:
- Block propagation and validation
- P2P network communication  
- State synchronization

**Estimated**: 1-5 TB/month additional data transfer
- Cloud providers: $90-600/month (after free tiers)
- Bare metal: Usually unlimited or much cheaper

#### Operational Costs
- **Monitoring & Management**: $20-50/month
- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**: $10-50/month
- **Security & Maintenance**: Variable

### Recommendations

#### For Cost Optimization
- **Bare Metal** (Hetzner/OVHcloud): **$48-60/month**
  - Best price/performance ratio
  - Unlimited bandwidth typically included
  - Good for validators in stable regions

#### For Enterprise/Production
- **AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances**: **$199–300/month** (estimate)
  - Better SLA/support, mature IAM/KMS
  - Easier scaling and management
  - Multi-AZ placement recommended to reduce outage risk

- **Bare Metal Enterprise** (Cherry Servers): **$120/month**
  - Dedicated hardware performance
  - Ensure spare-host or hot-standby for failover
#### For High Performance
- Ensure NVMe SSD storage for validator requirements
- Consider dedicated bandwidth allocation
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting

### Key Considerations

#### Performance Requirements
- ZetaChain validators need high IOPS (12K+)
- NVMe SSDs strongly recommended over regular SSDs
- Network latency critical for validator performance

#### Reliability Factors
- Uptime requirements for validator rewards
- Slashing risks with poor performance
- Geographic distribution considerations
