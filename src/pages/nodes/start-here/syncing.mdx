# Option 1: Snapshot method

Downloads the data directory backed up from an existing node.

Choose the network and snapshot type, download the snapshot and extract the snapshot
inside `~/.zetacored` directory.

<NodeSnapshots apiUrl="https://snapshots.rpc.zetachain.com" />

<Alert variant="warning">
  Our **archive snapshots** are now available in a **multipart** format. You can download each part individually by
  clicking **"Show Parts"** and selecting the desired one. Alternatively, you can streamline the process by copying the
  provided **POSIX download script**. This script automates **downloading, packing, and extracting** the full snapshot.
  Simply click the **"Copy to Clipboard"** icon below the parts list to copy the one-liner command and run it on a
  terminal.
</Alert>

<Alert variant="warning">
  Snapshots database backend is **pebbledb**. Ensure that your node is configured to use the same backend to utilize our
  snapshots.

# Option 2: KYVE's KSYNC method

The following doc covers a step by step guide on how to sync a ZetaChain Mainnet
node with KSYNC.

KSYNC is a tool capable of syncing blocks and state-sync snapshots from the
decentralized KYVE data lake directly into Cosmos blockchain nodes. With KSYNC
Cosmos validators don't need to wait for peers in order to block-sync and they
don't need to search for trusted app hashes if they want to state-sync.
Furthermore, state-syncing to historical heights up to genesis are possible.

More information about KSYNC can be found here: https://docs.kyve.network/ksync

### Install KSYNC

Install the latest KSYNC:

```
go install github.com/KYVENetwork/ksync/cmd/ksync@latest
```

Verify the installation:

```
ksync version
```

### Configure the Node

And change the following config in the `config.toml` file:

```text filename="~/.zetacored/config/config.toml"
db_backend = "goleveldb"
```

Changing the db_backend to the default goleveldb is required for now, since
KSYNC does not yet support the pebbledb from ZetaChainâ€™s dependency
https://github.com/BlockPILabs/cosmos-db.

### Sync the Node

```
ksync state-sync --binary="/path/to/zetacored" --chain-id=zetachain_7000-1 --snapshot-pool-id=11
```

# Checking Node Health

### Check Logs

To confirm that the node is working, you can watch the logs. The node should be
printing `INF` logs like these:

```
4:10AM INF executed block height=3468229 module=state num_invalid_txs=1 num_valid_txs=24 server=node
4:10AM INF commit synced commit=436F6D6D697449447B5B3139332032323120323438203430203230
4:10AM INF committed state app_hash=C1DDF828CB4126E8239D92FB57006D978664911BF75FDB2606804083C4F65354 height=3468229
4:10AM INF indexed block events height=3468229 module=txindex server=node
4:11AM INF Timed out dur=4468.382473 height=3468230 module=consensus round=0 server=node step=1
```

### Query Node Status

You can confirm that the node is synced by querying the node status endpoint:

```
curl localhost:26657/status
```

Make sure that `catching_up` is false. Also, check `latest_block_height` and
`latest_block_time`.
