## General

### What is ZetaChain?

An EVM-compatible L1 blockchain that connects everything. ZetaChain make it easy
to build interoperable dApps that span any chain including Bitcoin. It
facilitates cross-chain and cross-layer value transfer, message delivery, and
smart contract calls — thus enabling for the first time omnichain dApps (odApps)
which can leverage liquidity on multiple networks and read and update states on
all connected networks.

Read more about ZetaChain [here](/about).

### Why is ZETA used as an intermediary token? Are intermediary tokens “bad”?

ZETA is used for many aspects of the network, including as an intermediary token
in the case of cross-chain value transfer. The coin is used as gas for the
network, just as ETH is used on Ethereum, as well as for maintaining and
incentivizing decentralization in the network — staking, bonding, slashing, and
so on. These properties provably provide a sustainable foundation to the
ZetaChain network's security, longevity, and scalability, especially when
compared to many other existing interoperability solutions which can be
centralized, poorly incentivized, and unsustainable long-term. Any asset or data
can still be transacted across any connected chain. Having ZETA as the
denomination of value moving cross-chain also provides ZetaChain an extremely
minimized attack surface that is not vulnerable to many of the exploits that
many projects in the interoperability space are susceptible to.

### What is ZETA?

ZETA is ZetaChain's native coin, one of the first coins that is natively issued
across many chains. ZETA is used for many aspects of the network, including as
an intermediary token in the case of cross-chain value transfer. The coin is
used as gas for the network, just as ETH is used on Ethereum, as well as for
maintaining and incentivizing decentralization in the network — staking,
bonding, slashing, and so on. These properties provably provide a sustainable
foundation to the ZetaChain network's security, longevity, and scalability,
especially when compared to many other existing interoperability solutions which
can be centralized, poorly incentivized, and unsustainable long-term. Any asset
or data can still be transacted across any connected chain. Having ZETA as the
denomination of value moving cross-chain also provides ZetaChain an extremely
minimized attack surface that is not vulnerable to many of the exploits that
many projects in the interoperability space are susceptible to.

### How do fees work on ZetaChain?

A user pays for all fees within a single transaction when performing cross-chain
actions through ZetaChain. All fees (ZetaChain network fees, destination gas
fees) are bundled in a single transaction.

### What is an omnichain dApp?

An omnichain dApp is a decentralized application that functions seamlessly
across blockchains and layers through ZetaChain. This can take the form of smart
contracts deployed on various chains which interact by passing messages and
value through ZetaChain, smart contracts deployed directly on ZetaChain which
manage assets on any or all connected chains, or some combination thereof.

### Is ZetaChain a "sidechain"?

No, ZetaChain is an L1 smart-contract-enabled blockchain that has chain-agnostic
interoperability built in. It is not a sidechain, rollup, or bridge.

### How does ZetaChain compare to LayerZero?

ZetaChain is a full Layer 1 blockchain with native cross-chain capabilities
built into its consensus layer, while LayerZero is a messaging protocol that
connects existing blockchains through external verifiers and executors.

Key differences:

- Architecture: ZetaChain operates as a hub-and-spoke with its own validators
  using Proof-of-Stake consensus. LayerZero acts as lightweight messaging
  middleware between chains.
- Security: ZetaChain uses validator consensus with Byzantine Fault Tolerance
  and Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS). LayerZero relies on customizable
  Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs) and Executors that you choose.
- Bitcoin support: ZetaChain natively supports Bitcoin and non-smart-contract
  chains through its validator observation system. LayerZero requires smart
  contracts on both chains, so Bitcoin isn't supported.
- Developer experience: With ZetaChain, you deploy one Universal Smart Contract
  that can interact with any connected chain. With LayerZero, you deploy
  separate contracts on each chain and handle message passing between them.

Why choose ZetaChain: For developers building omnichain applications that
require Bitcoin integration, gas abstraction, or complex multi-chain logic,
ZetaChain offers a fundamentally simpler approach. Deploy once on ZetaChain's
EVM and orchestrate atomic cross-chain interactions—including native Bitcoin
transactions—from a single contract with automatic rollback handling.
LayerZero's customizable security model works well for simple EVM-to-EVM token
bridging, but ZetaChain's unified execution layer eliminates the complexity of
deploying and synchronizing contracts across multiple chains, while uniquely
enabling Bitcoin-native DeFi without bridges or wrappers.

### How does ZetaChain compare to Axelar?

ZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain with native cross-chain execution built into
its consensus layer, while Axelar is a messaging and token-routing network that
connects blockchains through General Message Passing (GMP) and gateway
contracts.

Key differences:

- Architecture: ZetaChain executes cross-chain logic natively on its own
  blockchain through Universal Smart Contracts, enabling true atomic
  composability. Axelar routes messages between chains where application logic
  runs separately on each source/destination chain, requiring manual state
  synchronization and coordination.
- Security: Both use PoS validator networks, but ZetaChain validators directly
  control external chain addresses via TSS with full on-chain consensus. Axelar
  relies on gateway contracts to verify attestations, adding an extra trust
  layer at each destination.
- Bitcoin support: ZetaChain offers genuine native Bitcoin integration through
  validator-run full nodes and TSS—no bridges, no wrappers, no intermediaries.
  Axelar requires intermediary layers like Stacks and Babylon partnerships,
  which don't provide direct Bitcoin protocol interaction.
- Developer experience: ZetaChain dramatically simplifies development—deploy one
  Universal Smart Contract that orchestrates atomic cross-chain logic from a
  single location with automatic rollback on failure. Axelar requires deploying
  separate contracts on each chain, managing asynchronous message passing, and
  manually handling state synchronization and retries.
- Gas handling: ZetaChain's ZRC-20 gas abstraction provides a unified fee model
  across all chains, dramatically improving UX. Axelar's Gas Service requires
  prepayment management and still consumes gas on multiple chains.
- Deployment complexity: ZetaChain offers single-deployment omnichain apps with
  built-in composability. Axelar requires multiple deployments across chains
  with fragmented state and asynchronous coordination overhead.

Why choose ZetaChain: For developers building the next generation of omnichain
applications, ZetaChain's unified execution model delivers superior simplicity,
true atomic composability, and native Bitcoin access without intermediaries.
Unlike Axelar's messaging middleware approach that requires multi-chain
coordination, ZetaChain provides a purpose-built execution layer where you can
orchestrate across all chains—including Bitcoin—with the ease of single-chain
development.

### How does ZetaChain compare to Wormhole?

ZetaChain is a Layer 1 blockchain with native cross-chain execution built into
its consensus layer, while Wormhole is a messaging middleware network that
connects blockchains through off-chain Guardian attestations.

Key differences:

- Architecture: ZetaChain operates as a purpose-built Layer 1 with its own
  Proof-of-Stake validators using CometBFT consensus. Wormhole acts as messaging
  middleware where 19 permissioned Guardians sign Verified Action Approvals
  (VAAs) off-chain.
- Security: ZetaChain uses on-chain Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus with
  cryptoeconomic staking and slashing—validators have real capital at risk.
  Wormhole relies on a Proof-of-Authority model where 13 of 19 Guardians must
  sign messages, based on reputation rather than economic stake.
- Bitcoin support: ZetaChain natively supports Bitcoin through direct validator
  observation and TSS signing—no Layer 2s or intermediaries required. Wormhole
  integrates Bitcoin indirectly through Stacks Layer 2, meaning assets must
  first exist on Stacks before bridging, adding an additional trust layer.
- Developer experience: With ZetaChain, you deploy one Universal Smart Contract
  that orchestrates atomic cross-chain logic with unified state and automatic
  revert handling. With Wormhole, you deploy separate contracts on each chain
  and manually coordinate asynchronous message passing with state reconciliation
  across multiple instances.
- Consensus model: ZetaChain achieves cryptographic finality through on-chain
  consensus where two-thirds of validators must agree. Wormhole uses off-chain
  Guardian signatures with a fixed permissioned validator set controlled through
  governance.

Why choose ZetaChain: For developers building omnichain applications that
require native Bitcoin support, atomic cross-chain execution, or unified state
management, ZetaChain provides fundamentally stronger infrastructure. Its
single-deployment model eliminates the complexity of coordinating contracts
across chains, while cryptoeconomic security through staking and slashing
creates real financial consequences for misbehavior. Most critically,
ZetaChain's direct Bitcoin integration enables true Bitcoin-powered DeFi without
Layer 2 intermediaries, while Wormhole requires assets to first exist on Stacks
L2 before bridging. ZetaChain delivers purpose-built blockchain infrastructure
for the omnichain future with mathematically proven Byzantine Fault Tolerance,
versus Wormhole's off-chain messaging layer secured by a small permissioned
Guardian set.

### Is ZetaChain a bridge? How is it different from a bridge?

ZetaChain is not a bridge. At its core, ZetaChain is a blockchain and
interoperability smart contract and messaging platform. One can build
need-specific bridges through ZetaChain, although ZetaChain has omnichain value
transfer built-in. Transferring value through ZetaChain also does not require
wrapping of assets. Wrapped assets and centralized vaults are often the points
of failure or exploits that result in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars
that are not uncommon (Wormhole hack, Poly Network hack). With ZetaChain, all
funds at rest are not at risk, because there is no interdependency via
wrapping/locking.

### What's the difference between ZetaChain messaging and smart contracts?

Messaging allows a developer to send data and value between smart contracts,
whether they are on ZetaChain or on connected chains. One can deploy smart
contracts on connected chains and just pass messages between them through
ZetaChain in a similar manner to other interoperability messaging protocols like
LayerZero, but ZetaChain's interoperable smart contracts let developers maintain
omnichain logic within a single place, reducing overhead and enabling smart
contract logic to control even non-smart-contract chains like Bitcoin and
Dogecoin.

## Security

### How does ZetaChain handle a case where a source TX is reverted (e. g. on a PoW chain due to an attack)?

Upon detection of the very deep re-organization, ZetaChain will halt and the
recovery would be a social process between various stakeholders including
ZetaChain validators and team, dApps developers, and end users. The dApps
developers should build in the capability to resolve inconsistent states due to
the very deep re-organization.

### Is there an interface where we can run a PoS validator?

Check out the validator docs [here](/nodes/start-here/requirements).

## Testnet and Mainnet

### Is ZetaChain mainnet live?

Yes, ZetaChain mainnet is live and fully operational. You can build and deploy
Universal Apps to production today. Mainnet supports cross-chain transactions
across multiple connected blockchains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNB Chain,
Polygon, Base, Sui, TON, and others. For development and testing, use our
testnet environment which mirrors mainnet functionality or Localnet environment
for faster development.

### How do I get ZETA?

You can request testnet ZETA in the faucet channel on our Discord server or use
the faucet on the command line, learn more in the [faucet
docs](/reference/faucet). This testnet ZETA does not and will never have any
monetary value. It is solely for testing purposes, so that people can experience
the use and power of ZetaChain.

### Does testnet ZETA have any value?

No, testnet ZETA does not have any value, and will never have any monetary
value. Performing transactions or acquiring ZETA on testnet networks is purely
for testing purposes.
