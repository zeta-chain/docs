ZetaChain has a comprehensive bug bounty program aimed at maintaining the
security of its web applications, smart contracts, and the blockchain. As an
EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain that connects various networks, including
Bitcoin, ZetaChain is committed to building a robust and secure ecosystem for
interoperable apps.

The bug bounty program invites security researchers to identify and report
vulnerabilities across ZetaChain’s web applications, smart contracts, and
blockchain components. The program covers a wide range of potential security
risks, including business logic issues, unauthorized transactions, reentrancy,
cryptographic flaws, and more. Rewards are determined based on the severity and
impact of the vulnerability, with a particular focus on critical issues that may
affect user funds, consensus, or network functionality.

To participate in the program, all security findings should be reported through
ZetaChain’s official bug bounty platform on HackenProof.

Researchers are required to follow responsible disclosure guidelines, ensuring
that vulnerabilities are reported confidentially, without public disclosure, and
only after the vulnerability has been resolved.

The scope of the bug bounty includes web applications such as the ZetaChain
explorer, smart contract repositories, and blockchain components. Only
vulnerabilities found within the specified scope will be eligible for rewards.
Researchers are encouraged to thoroughly test within the allowed boundaries
while adhering to the program’s rules on ethical hacking practices.
