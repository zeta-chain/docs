# The Graph 

Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) provides an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph‚Äôs infrastructure relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized.

## Quick Start

These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. To get started, follow these three steps:

1. Initialize your subgraph project
2. Deploy & Publish
3. Query from your dapp

Here‚Äôs a step by step walk through:

## 1. Initialize your subgraph project

### Create a subgraph on Subgraph Studio‚Å†

Go to the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio/) and connect your wallet. Once your wallet is connected, you can begin by clicking ‚ÄúCreate a Subgraph‚Äù. When choosing a name, it is recommended to use Title Case: ‚ÄúSubgraph Name Chain Name.‚Äù

![Create a Subgraph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/main/img/studio-create-subgraph.png)


You will then land on your subgraph‚Äôs page. All the CLI commands you need will be visible on the right side of the page:

![CLI commands](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/zetachain/img/studio-graphcli-commands.png)


### Install the Graph CLI‚Å†

On your local machine run the following:
```
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

### Initialize your Subgraph‚Å†

You can copy this directly from your subgraph page to include your specific subgraph slug:
```
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
You‚Äôll be prompted to provide some info on your subgraph like this:

![cli sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/zetachain/img/cli-sample.png)


Simply have your contract verified on the block explorer and the CLI will automatically obtain the ABI and set up your subgraph. If it fails to fetch ABI or other info, simply retrying will usually resolve the problem. 

## 2. Deploy & Publish

### Deploy to Subgraph Studio‚Å†

First run these commands:

```bash
$ graph codegen
$ graph build
```

Then run these to authenticate and deploy your subgraph. You can copy these commands directly from your subgraph‚Äôs page in Studio to include your specific deploy key and subgraph slug:

```bash
$ graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
$ graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

You will be asked for a version label. You can enter something like v0.0.1, but you‚Äôre free to choose the format.

### Test your subgraph‚Å†

You can test your subgraph by making a sample query in the playground section. The Details tab will show you an API endpoint. You can use that endpoint to test from your dapp.

### Publish Your Subgraph to The Graph‚Äôs Decentralized Network

Once your subgraph is ready to be put into production, you can publish it to the decentralized network. On your subgraph‚Äôs page in Subgraph Studio, click on the Publish button:

![publish button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/zetachain/img/studio-publish-button.png)


You'll need some ETH on Arbitrum One to create an on-chain transaction. The Graph's smart contracts are all on Arbitrum One, even if your subgraph is indexing data from another chain.

![Publish screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/zetachain/img/studio-publish-modal.png)

> **Note:** When publishing, a "Partial Indexer Support" alert means subgraphs on this chain are indexed by The Graph's default indexer but not by independent indexers. Testnets always have this limitation. For mainnets, this warning will go away after a voting process enables indexer rewards for the chain, at which point you can attract multiple indexers to your subgraph. 

## 3. Query your Subgraph

Congratulations! You can now query your subgraph on the decentralized network!

For any subgraph on the decentralized network, you can start querying it by passing a GraphQL query into the subgraph‚Äôs query URL which can be found at the top of its Explorer page.

Here‚Äôs an example from the [CryptoPunks Ethereum subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycHgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK) by Messari:

![Query URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/main/img/explorer-query-url.png)


The query URL for this subgraph is:

`https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/`**[api-key]**`/subgraphs/id/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK`

Now, you simply need to¬† fill in your own API Key to start sending GraphQL queries to this endpoint.

### Getting your own API Key

![API keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alinobrasil/the_graph_getting_started/refs/heads/main/img/getting-api-key.png)


In Subgraph Studio, you‚Äôll see the ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù menu at the top of the page. Here you can create API Keys.

## Appendix

### Sample Query

This query shows the most expensive CryptoPunks sold.

```graphql
{
  trades(orderBy: priceETH, orderDirection: desc) {
    priceETH
    tokenId
  }
}

```

Passing this into the query URL returns this result:

```
{
  "data": {
    "trades": [
      {
        "priceETH": "124457.067524886018255505",
        "tokenId": "9998"
      },
      {
        "priceETH": "8000",
        "tokenId": "5822"
      },
//      ...
```

<aside>
üí° Trivia: Looking at the top sales on [CryptoPunks website](https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/topsales) it looks like the top sale is Punk #5822, not #9998. Why? Because they censor the flash-loan sale that happened.

</aside>

### Sample code

```jsx
const axios = require('axios');

const graphqlQuery = `{
  trades(orderBy: priceETH, orderDirection: desc) {
    priceETH
    tokenId
  }
}`;
const queryUrl = 'https://gateway-arbitrum.network.thegraph.com/api/[api-key]/subgraphs/id/HdVdERFUe8h61vm2fDyycHgxjsde5PbB832NHgJfZNqK'

const graphQLRequest = {
  method: 'post',
  url: queryUrl,
  data: {
    query: graphqlQuery,
  },
};

// Send the GraphQL query
axios(graphQLRequest)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response here
    const data = response.data.data
    console.log(data)

  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors
    console.error(error);
  });
```
