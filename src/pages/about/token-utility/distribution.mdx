title: ZETA Distribution

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

## Overview

The initial supply of ZETA is distributed across the following allocations. The
total initial supply of ZETA is 2,100,000,000. After approximately 4 years based
on a set curve, the protocol will plan to initiate a target of ~2.5% yearly
inflation based on the current circulating supply. ZetaChain also has a
governance model that allows for additional monetary policy to promote its goal
of long-term sustainability.

Holders who have locked ZETA may use the ZETA to stake to validators in order to
provide security to the network and validate transactions. Locked ZETA may only
be staked, not used for any other purposes. Some third parties may count staked
ZETA as part of circulating supply. The amount of locked tokens that are staked
is dynamic, and the total live amount of staked tokens can be found by querying
the blockchain or viewing a relevant explorer. Different parties may employ
different methodologies for calculating or tracking circulating, staked, or
total token supply.

### User Growth Pool

This portion is allocated towards incentivizing usage and growing the user-base
of ZetaChain. This will be distributed through various initiatives which are
based on active, meaningful user behaviors. For example, this portion will be
used for programs like the ZetaLabs airdrop, wallet campaigns, and other
community-focused rewards to raise awareness of ZetaChain utility features and
usage thereof.

### Ecosystem Growth Fund

This portion is allocated towards partners and developers contributing to the
ZetaChain ecosystem. For example, incentives to help dApp developers get started
through a grant program or for wallet partners to support ZetaChain natively.

### Validator Incentives

A portion of the total initial supply (10%) is allocated to the initial
emissions pool on ZetaChain. This pool allows for block rewards targeted to
sustain and secure the network over the first 4 years of network growth. After
this pools is depleted, the protocol will introduce a planned 2.5% inflation
through validator rewards, separate from the emission curve. You can read more
about Validator Incentives and distributions
[here](/about/token-utility/validators).

### Liquidity Incentives

The assets managed by the network’s TSS have an allocation of rewards that
incentivize providing liquidity that is usable on ZetaChain's EVM. This portion
is allocated towards incentivizing liquidity that is crucial for the protocol
and ecosystem to function and maintain stability, in order to facilitate
low-slippage and minimal gas-usage transfers of value through and on ZetaChain.

To incentivize liquidity in pools such as the Core ZRC-20 pools, this pool will
be used to provide on-chain incentives for them to help bootstrap a seamless
transaction experience for users and developers.

### Protocol Treasury

The treasury pool is allocated towards ecosystem and community initiatives aimed
at improving the ZetaChain ecosystem such as network insurance, bug bounties,
protocol development and bounties, and operations.

### Core Contributors, Advisors, and Purchasers

ZETA are allocated to Purchasers as well as Core Contributors and Advisors who
earned tokens for their contributions to the ZetaChain network.

## Token Distribution Log

### Oct 23rd, 2024:
To enhance security and decentralization, 1.5B ZETA tokens have been permanently anchored to ZetaChain’s native network. While ZETA can still be transferred back to Ethereum as an ERC-20, the maximum amount that can be moved to Ethereum is now capped at 600M.

This update has no effect on total supply, circulating supply, nor any network participant's ZETA. The total ZETA supply across chains remains 2.1B, with no impact on functionality. Circulating supply schedule for all network participants also remains unchanged.

The ZETA token anchoring improves ZetaChain’s security by ensuring 1.5B ZETA is permanently secured by ZetaChain’s native network, rather than the ERC-20 contract. This is a key step toward decentralization and improved safety for users and developers.

Additionally, this move prepares ZetaChain for upcoming chain integrations, laying a more secure foundation for Universal Apps that can span any blockchain from Ethereum to Bitcoin and more.
