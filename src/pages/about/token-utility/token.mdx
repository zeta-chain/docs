# ZETA Token

The total initial supply of ZETA is 2,100,000,000 (two billion, one hundred
million). After approximately 4 years based on a set curve, the protocol will
plan to initiate a target of ~2.5% yearly inflation based on the current
circulating supply, providing a mechanism to sustain the network into the
future. ZetaChain also has a governance model that allows for upgrades into
additional monetary policy, among other network modifications, to further its
goal of long-term sustainability and to adjust based on ecosystem needs.

### ZETA’s Utility

ZETA is used as **gas** for ZetaChain’s omnichain smart contracts layer and
internal transactions. With transactions like EIP 1559, some ZETA is burned over
time.

ZETA is used in core pools that the protocol uses to exchange for external
ZRC-20 gas assets to pay for and **write outbound transactions to external
chains**.

ZETA is used as a **cross-chain intermediary asset** through messaging. When a
cross-chain message is sent, a dApp/user attaches ZETA in his message to
represent value and to pay for all gas and transaction fees in a single bundle.
ZETA is also exchanged on the core pools to pay for outbound gas.

ZETA is core to **securing the PoS blockchain**. Validators stake and users may
delegate ZETA to validators, earning block emissions.

ZETA is used for voting in **governance** proposals (network, policy upgrades,
etc.).
