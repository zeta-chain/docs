Building universal applications with ZetaChain and Solana is easy. You can
deposit SOL and SPL-20 tokens directly from Solana into accounts or smart
contracts on ZetaChain. Universal contracts on ZetaChain can handle these
deposits and execute contract calls initiated from the Solana blockchain.

- In this tutorial, you'll:
- Set up a local development environment using localnet.
- Deploy a universal contract on ZetaChain.
- Deposit tokens (SOL and SPL-20) from Solana to ZetaChain.
- Execute deposit-and-call transactions, depositing tokens and calling a
  universal app simultaneously.
- Withdraw tokens back to Solana, optionally calling Solana programs as part of
  the withdrawal.

Interactions with universal apps from Solana are handled by the Solana Gateway
program, [learn more about it in the docs](/developers/chains/solana).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed and configured the following before starting:

- [`solana` CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation)

## Clone the Example Project

Start by creating a project and installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npx zetachain@latest new --project call
cd call
yarn
```

## Launch Localnet

This command brings up the local development environment with ZetaChain and
Solana:

```bash
yarn zetachain localnet start
```

Leave this running in one terminal window.

## Compile and Deploy an Example Universal Contract

In a new terminal window, compile and deploy the universal contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile --force
npx hardhat deploy --name Universal --network localhost --gateway 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707
```

You will see a confirmation with your contract address:

```
ðŸš€ Successfully deployed "Universal" contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7
```

Keep track of the contract address for later (in this example,
`0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7`).

## Deposit

Deposit SOL tokens from Solana to ZetaChain:

```
npx hardhat localnet:solana-deposit \
  --receiver 0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7 \
  --amount 0.1
```

--receiver: Universal contract address on ZetaChain.

--amount: Amount of SOL to deposit.

## Deposit and Call

Deposit tokens and simultaneously call the deployed universal contract:

```bash
npx hardhat localnet:solana-deposit-and-call \
  --receiver 0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7 \
  --amount 0.1 \
  --types '["string"]' hello
```

This command deposits tokens and triggers the universal contract function with
the argument "hello".

## Withdraw Tokens to Solana

Withdraw tokens from ZetaChain back to Solana:

```bash
npx hardhat zetachain-withdraw \
  --gateway-zeta-chain 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 \
  --receiver DrexsvCMH9WWjgnjVbx1iFf3YZcKadupFmxnZLfSyotd \
  --network localhost \
  --zrc20 0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891 \
  --amount 0.1
```

- `--gateway-zeta-chain`: Address of the ZetaChain gateway.
- `--receiver`: A Solana wallet address to receive the withdrawn tokens.
- `--zrc20`: The ZetaChain representation of the token you want to withdraw
  (ZRC-20 address).
- `--amount`: The amount to withdraw.

## Withdraw and Call a Program on Solana

Beyond simply withdrawing tokens from ZetaChain back to Solana, you can also
execute a Solana program as part of the withdrawal process. This allows for more
complex interactions, such as triggering on-chain logic immediately upon
receiving funds. For example, you can withdraw SOL or SPL-20 tokens and call a
Solana program in a single transaction, enabling use cases like automatic
staking, swaps, or contract executions.

The `solana` directory contains an example Solana program with an `on_call`
function, which can be invoked by a universal app on ZetaChain during the
withdrawal process.

The following steps will guide you through setting up an example Solana program
and using the ZetaChain Gateway to perform a "withdraw and call".

### Build and Set Up the Example Solana Program

Set the SPL-20 USDC address. You can find this address in a table in the output
of `localnet`:

```bash
USDC_SPL=3Kx5SY7SwzdUZSorLVSpPgxBL8DZFiu8mg4FWduu2tQp
```

```bash
cd solana && anchor build && npx ts-node setup/main.ts "$USDC_SPL" && cd -
```

After running this, you should see output indicating that the program was
successfully deployed, such as:

```
Connected program deployment output: Program Id: 9BjVGjn28E58LgSi547JYEpqpgRoo1TErkbyXiRSNDQy
```

### Withdraw SOL and Call the Solana Program

Make a call to the ZetaChain Gateway to withdraw SOL and call a program on
Solana:

```bash
npx hardhat zetachain-withdraw-and-call \
  --receiver 9BjVGjn28E58LgSi547JYEpqpgRoo1TErkbyXiRSNDQy \
  --gateway-zeta-chain 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 \
  --zrc20 0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891 \
  --amount 0.01 \
  --network localhost \
  --types '["bytes"]' $(npx ts-node solana/setup/encodeCallArgs.ts "sol" "$USDC_SPL")
```

- `--receiver`: The Solana program ID you want to call.
- `--types '["bytes"]'`: Specifies that the contract call argument is a bytes
  array (the encoded Solana call data).
- `"$ENCODED_ACCOUNTS_AND_DATA"`: The encoded Solana program call arguments we
  generated in the previous step.
- `--zrc20`: ZRC-20 address of SOL on ZetaChain.

### Withdraw SPL-20 and Call the Solana Program

Make a call to the ZetaChain Gateway to withdraw ZRC-20 SPL-20 USDC and call a
program on Solana:

```bash
npx hardhat zetachain-withdraw-and-call \
  --receiver 9BjVGjn28E58LgSi547JYEpqpgRoo1TErkbyXiRSNDQy \
  --gateway-zeta-chain 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 \
  --zrc20 0x48f80608B672DC30DC7e3dbBd0343c5F02C738Eb \
  --amount 0.01 \
  --network localhost \
  --types '["bytes"]' $(npx ts-node solana/setup/encodeCallArgs.ts "spl" "$USDC_SPL")
```

- `--zrc20`: ZRC-20 address of SPL-20 USDC on ZetaChain.

In this tutorial youâ€™ve learned how to deploy a universal contract on ZetaChain,
deposit SOL and SPL-20 tokens from Solana, call contracts during deposits,
withdraw assets back to Solana, and even trigger Solana programs upon
withdrawal.
