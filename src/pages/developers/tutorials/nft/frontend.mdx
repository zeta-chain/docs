title: Frontend dApp
---

import { CodeBlock } from "~/components/shared";

## Overview

In this section, you will create a frontend dApp that allows users to deposit
native tokens on connected chains to mint NFTs on ZetaChain, view their
collection, burn NFTs to withdraw native tokens from ZetaChain and transfer NFTs
to other addresses on ZetaChain.

This UI is built as part of
[the example frontend project](https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend),
but you can replicate it in your own project.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the
  [NFT Omnichain Contract](/developers/tutorials/nft/contract)
  tutorial. Make sure that you've configured Goldsky to index events from your
  contract.

## Page Layout

The entry point of the frontend dApp is the `NFTPage` component. It is
responsible for rendering the page layout and the widgets that trigger
broadcasting of transactions.

The `NFTPage` component uses the `useNFT` hook to access the state of the
frontend dApp. The `useNFT` hook is responsible for managing the state of the
frontend dApp and for broadcasting transactions.

On component load the `NFTPage` component calls the `fetchNFTs` function to
fetch the NFTs owned by the connected address.

<CodeBlock
  language="tsx"
  filename="app/nft/page.tsx"
  codeUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend/main/app/nft/page.tsx"
/>

## useNFT Hook

`useNFT` is a simple component that stores the state of the frontend dApp.

<CodeBlock
  language="tsx"
  filename="app/nft/useNFT.tsx"
  codeUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend/main/app/nft/useNFT.tsx"
/>

## Fetching NFTs

The hook is responsible for fetching NFTs owned by the connected address.

Set the constant to store the URL of the subgraph that you deployed in the
previous section.

Goldsky is a subgraph indexer that uses GraphQL to query events from your
contract. Write a query that fetches all `Transfer` events. You're interested in
transfers that were sent to or from a specific address. In the body of the query
specify the fields your're interested in.

The function to fetch NFT makes a GraphQL request to the subgraph to fetch the
`transfer` events. The function then filters the events to find the NFTs that
are currently owned by the address by checking which NFTs were sent to the
address and which NFTs were sent from the address.

Since you're using the default ERC-721 Transfer event, you only have the
`tokenId` field that contains the ID of the NFT. You will need to query the
contract to get the chain ID and the amount of the NFT.

To correctly format the amount of tokens in NFTs, you to know the number of
decimals of the corresponding ZRC-20 token. Query the foreign coins endpoints to
find the decimals and use to correctly format the amounts.

Finally, sort NFTs by ID in descending order.

## Minting NFTs

To mint an NFT on ZetaChain you need to deposit native tokens on a connected
chain to the TSS address.

For Bitcoin use the supported XDEFI wallet. Format the request correctly with
the recipient (TSS address), amount (in sats) and memo (the address that will
receive the NFT on ZetaChain), and call the `request` method.

For EVM chains, just use `sendTransaction` to send a token transfer transaction
to the TSS address with the amount of tokens that you want to deposit and the
recipient address in the data field.

Next, if the transaction was successful, use the transaction hash to track the
progress of the cross-chain transaction.

<CodeBlock
  language="ts"
  filename="app/nft/mint.ts"
  codeUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend/main/app/nft/mint.ts"
/>

## Burning NFTs

Burning NFTs happens on ZetaChain. To burn an NFT, you need to approve an NFT
first, then call the `burn` method on the omnichain contract. The `burn` method
takes the ID of the NFT as an argument.

Due to fluctuating gas prices, a transaction might fail. To make sure that the
user has best experience possible, implement a recursive check for approval.
This function will check if a user has approved the omnichain contract to burn
an NFT. If the user has not approved the contract, the function will ask for an
approval. Implement a similar function to check for ownership of the NFT.

In the body of the function call the approval function, once the approval is
received, call burn the NFT and start checking for ownership. As soon as the
user is no longer the owner of the NFT, update the frontend dApp state.

<CodeBlock
  language="ts"
  filename="app/nft/burn.ts"
  codeUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend/main/app/nft/burn.ts"
/>

## Transferring NFTs

Transferring NFTS happens on ZetaChain and does not involve any cross-chain
interactions. Simple call the contract's transfer method and pass the recipient,
the sender and the ID of the NFT.

<CodeBlock
  language="ts"
  filename="app/nft/transfer.ts"
  codeUrl="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeta-chain/example-frontend/main/app/nft/transfer.ts"
/>

## Congratulations!

You've successfully created a frontend dApp that allows users to mint, burn and
transfer NFTs on ZetaChain.
