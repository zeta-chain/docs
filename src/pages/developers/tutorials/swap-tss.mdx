title: Swap on Testnet
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

In this tutorial you will create a cross-chain swap contract. This contract will
enable users to exchange a native gas token or a supported ERC-20 token from one
connected blockchain for a token on another blockchain. For example, a user will
be able to swap USDC from Ethereum to BTC on Bitcoin in a single transaction.

<Alert>
  {" "}
  This tutorial features architecture that is compatible with the current ZetaChain testnet, but will be phased out once
  the [gateway](/developers/evm/gateway) is released. For a gateway compatible localnet-only example check out [Swap on Localnet](/developers/tutorials/swap)
</Alert>

You will learn how to:

- Decode incoming messages from both EVM chains and Bitcoin.
- Work with the ZRC-20 representation of tokens transferred from connected
  chains.
- Use the swap helper function to swap tokens using Uniswap v2 pools.
- Withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to a connected chain, accounting for cross-chain gas
  fees.

The swap contract will be implemented as a universal app and deployed on
ZetaChain.

Universal apps can accept token transfers and contract calls from connected
chains. Tokens transferred from connected chains to a universal app contract are
represented as [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20). For example, ETH transferred
from Ethereum is represented as ZRC-20 ETH. ZRC-20 tokens have the unique
property of being able to be withdrawn back to their original chain as native
assets.

The swap contract will:

- Accept a contract call from a connected chain containing native gas or
  supported ERC-20 tokens and a message.
- Decode the message, which should include:
  - Target token address (represented as ZRC-20)
  - Recipient address on the destination chain
- Query withdraw gas fee of the target token.
- Swap a fraction of the input token for a ZRC-20 gas tokens to cover the
  withdrawal fee using the Uniswap v2 liquidity pools.
- Swap the remaining input token amount for the target token ZRC-20.
- Withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to the destination chain

## Set Up Your Environment

Clone the Hardhat contract template:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template

cd template/contracts

yarn
```

Make sure that you've followed the [Getting
Started](/developers/tutorials/intro) tutorial to set up your development
environment, create an account and request testnet tokens.

## Create the contract

Run the following command to create a new universal omnichain contract called
`Swap` with two values in the message: target token address and recipient.

```
npx hardhat omnichain Swap targetToken:address recipient
```

### Decoding the Message

Create a `Params` struct, which will hold two values:

- `address target`: target token ZRC-20 address.
- `bytes to`: recipient address on the destination chain. We're using `bytes`,
  because the recipient can be either on EVM (like Ethereum or BNB) or on
  Bitcoin.

First, decode the incoming `message` to get the parameter values. The message
might be encoded differently depending on the source chain. For example, on
Bitcoin there is a upper limit of 80 bytes, so you might want to encode the
message in the most efficient way possible. On EVM don't have this limit, so
it's fine to use `abi.encode` to encode the message.

Use `context.chainID` to determine the connected chain from which the contract
is called.

If it's Bitcoin, the first 20 bytes of the `message` are the `params.target`
encoded as an `address`. Use `bytesToAddress` helper method to get the target
token address. To get the recipient address, use the same helper method with an
offset of 20 bytes and then use `abi.encodePacked` to convert the address to
`bytes`.

If it's an EVM chain, use `abi.decode` to decode the `message` into the
`params.target` and `params.to`.

### Swap and Withdraw Function

#### Swapping for Gas Token

Create a new function called `swapAndWithdraw`. Use the `withdrawGasFee` method
of the target token ZRC-20 to get the gas fee token address and the gas fee
amount. If the target token is the gas token of the destination chain (for
example, BNB), `gasZRC20` will be the same `params.target`. However, if the
target token is an ERC-20, like USDC on BNB, `gasZRC20` will tell you the
address of the ZRC-20 of the destination chain.

Use the `swapTokensForExactTokens` helper method to swap the incoming token for
the gas coin using the internal liquidity pools. The method returns the amount
of the incoming token that was used to pay for the gas.

#### Swapping for Target Token

Next, swap the incoming amount minus the amount spent swapping for a gas fee for
the target token on the destination chain using the `swapExactTokensForTokens`
helper method.

#### Withdraw Target Token to Connected Chain

At this point the contract has the required `gasFee` amount of `gasZRC20` token
of the connected chain and an `outputAmount` amount of `params.target` token.

To withdraw tokens to a connected chain you will be calling the `withdraw`
method of ZRC-20. The `withdraw` method expects the caller (in our case the
contract) to have the required amount of gas tokens ZRC-20. Approve the target
token ZRC-20 contract to spend the `gasFee` amount. Finally, call the `withdraw`
method of the target token ZRC-20 to send the tokens to the recipient on the
connected chain.

<Alert>
  {" "}
  Note that you don't have to tell which chain to withdraw to because each ZRC-20 contract knows which connected chain it
  is associated with. For example, ZRC-20 Ethereum USDC can only be withdrawn to Ethereum.
</Alert>

## Update the Interact Task

In the `interact` task generated for us by the contract template the recipient
is encoded as string. Our contract, however, expects the recipient to be encoded
as `bytes` to ensure that both EVM and Bitcoin addresses are supported.

To support both EVM and Bitcoin addresses, we need to check if the recipient is
a valid Bitcoin address. If it is, we need to encode it as `bytes` using
`utils.solidityPack`.

If it’s not a valid bech32 address, then we assume it's an EVM address and use
`args.recipient` as the value for the recipient.

Finally, update the `prepareData` function call to use the `bytes` type for the
recipient.

```ts filename="tasks/interact.ts" {1,6-22}
import bech32 from "bech32";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  let recipient;
  try {
    if (bech32.decode(args.recipient)) {
      recipient = utils.solidityPack(["bytes"], [utils.toUtf8Bytes(args.recipient)]);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    recipient = args.recipient;
  }

  const data = prepareData(args.contract, ["address", "bytes"], [args.targetToken, recipient]);
  //...
};
```

## Create an Account and Request Tokens from the Faucet

Before proceeding with the next steps, make sure you have [created an account
and requested ZETA tokens](/developers/tutorials/hello#create-an-account) from
the faucet.

## Compile and Deploy the Contract

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet
```

## Swap Native Gas Tokens Between EVM Chains

Use the `interact` task to perform a cross-chain swap. In this example, we're
swapping native sETH from Sepolia for BNB on BNB chain. The contract will
deposit sETH to ZetaChain as ZRC-20, swap it for ZRC-20 BNB and then withdraw
native BNB to the BNB chain. To get the value of the `--target-token` find the
ZRC-20 contract address of the destination token in the [ZRC-20 section of the
docs](/developers/tokens/zrc20).

```
npx hardhat interact --contract 0x175DeE06ca605674e49F1FADfC6B399D6ab31726 --amount 0.3 --network sepolia_testnet --target-token 0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891 --recipient 0x4955a3F38ff86ae92A914445099caa8eA2B9bA32

## Swap ERC-20 Tokens Between EVM Chains

Now let's swap USDC from Sepolia to BNB on BNB chain. To send USDC specify the
ERC-20 token contract address (on Sepolia) in the `--token` parameter. You can
find the address of the token in the [ZRC-20 section of the
docs](/developers/tokens/zrc20).

## Swap from Bitcoin

Use the `send-btc` task to send Bitcoin to the TSS address with a memo. The memo
should contain the following:

- Omnichain contract address on ZetaChain:
  `175DeE06ca605674e49F1FADfC6B399D6ab31726`
- Target token address: `05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0`
