The project consists of two ERC-721 NFT contracts.

**Universal** contract is deployed on ZetaChain. The contract is used to:

- Mint NFTs on ZetaChain
- Transfer NFTs from ZetaChain to a connected chain
- Handle incoming NFT transfers from connected chain to ZetaChain
- Handle NFT transfers between connected chains

**Connected** contract is deployed one or more connected EVM chains. The
contract is used to:

- Mint an NFT on a connected chain
- Transfer NFT to another connected chain or ZetaChain
- Handling incoming NFT transfers from ZetaChain or another connected chain

A universal NFT can be minted on any chain: ZetaChain or any connected EVM
chain. When an NFT is minted, it gets assigned a persistent token ID that is
unique across all chains. When an NFT is transferred between chains, the token
ID remains the same.

An NFT can be transferred from ZetaChain to a connected chain, from a connected
chain to ZetaChain and between connected chains. ZetaChain acts as a hub for
cross-chain transactions, so all transfers go through ZetaChain. For example,
when you transfer an NFT from Ethereum to BNB, two cross-chain transactions are
initiated: Ethereum → ZetaChain → BNB. This doesn't impact the transfer time or
costs, but makes it easier to connect any number of chains.

Cross-chain NFT transfers are capable of handling reverts. If the transfer fails
on the destination chain, an NFT will be returned to the original sender on the
source chain.

NFT contracts only accept cross-chain calls from trusted "counterparty"
contracts. Each contract on a connected chain stores a "counterparty" address —
an address of the Universal contract on ZetaChain. The Universal contract stores
a list of "counterparty" contracts on connected chains. This ensures that only
the contracts from the same NFT collection can participate in the cross-chain
transfer.

<Alert>This tutorial relies on the Gateway, which is currently available only on localnet and testnet.</Alert>

### Minting an NFT

`safeMint` mint a new NFT. Token ID is generated from the contract address,
block time, and an incrementing integer. This ensures that the token ID is
unique across all chains. The only scenario where ID collision is possible is
when two contracts are deployed on the same address on two different chains, and
an NFT is minted on both exactly at the same time using the same integer. You
can supply your own logic for generating token IDs.

### Transfer NFT from ZetaChain to a Connected Chain

`transferCrossChain` transfers an NFT from ZetaChain to a connected chain.
Transferring an NFT to a connected chain creates a transaction on a connected
chain, which costs gas. To pay for gas, the NFT sender must provide the
universal app with tokens for gas in the form of ZRC-20 version of the gas token
of the connected chain. For example, when a user transfers an NFT from ZetaChain
to Ethereum, they need to allow the contract to spend a certain amount of ZRC-20
ETH.

The function transfers the ZRC-20 tokens to the gateway contract.

Next, the function encodes the token ID, sender's address and the URI into a
message.

`callOptions` are defined with the gas limit on the destination chain and
`isArbitraryCall` (the second parameter) is set to false. `isArbitraryCall`
determines if the call is arbitrary (a call to any contract on the destination
chain, but without providing address of the universal contract making the call)
or authenticated (the call is made to `onCall` function, the universal contract
address is passed as a parameter). Setting `isArbitraryCall` to false is
important, because the contract on a connected chain must know which universal
contract is making a call to prevent unauthorized calls.

`revertOptions` contain the address of a contract on ZetaChain, which will be
called if the contract on the destination chain reverts (in our example we want
to call the same universal contract), as well as the message that will be passed
to the `onRevert` function of the revert contract. Pass the same encoded message
to ensure that the universal contract can successfully mint the token back to
the sender if the transfer fails.

Finally, `gateway.call` is executed to initiate a cross-chain transfer of an NFT
from ZetaChain to a connected chain. The destination chain is determined by the
ZRC-20 contract address, which corresponds to the gas token of the connected
chain. For example, to transfer the NFT to Ethereum, pass address of ZRC-20 ETH.

### Handling NFT Transfers from Connected Chains

`onCall` is executed when an NFT transfer is received from a connected chain.

First, `onCall` checks that the transfer originates from a trusted counterparty
contract. This prevents unauthorized minting by malicious contracts.

Since all cross-chain transfers are processed by ZetaChain, there are two
scenarios when `onCall` is executed: when the destination is ZetaChain or when
the destination is another connected chain.

If the destination is a zero address, then the destination chain is ZetaChain.
An NFT is minted and transferred to the recipient.

If the destination is a non-zero address, the destination chain is another
connected chain identified by the ZRC-20 gas token address in the destination
field of the message. The contract initiates a transfer to the connected chain.
First, it queries the withdraw fee on the destination chain. Then, it swaps the
incoming ZRC-20 tokens into the ZRC-20 gas token of the destination chain. The
swap uses the built-in Uniswap v2 pools, but any other swap mechanism can be
used, instead. Finally, `gateway.call` is executed to initiate the transfer to
the destination chain.

### Revert Handling

If an NFT transfer from ZetaChain to a connected chain fails, `onRevert` is
called. `onRevert` mints the NFT and transfers it back to original sender.

### Transfer NFT from a Connected Chain

`transferCrossChain` initiates a transfer of an NFT to ZetaChain or to another
connected chain.

To transfer an NFT to ZetaChain the destination address must be specified as a
zero address.

To transfer an NFT to another connected chain the destination address must be
the ZRC-20 address of the gas token of the destination chain. For example, to
transfer to Ethereum, the destination is ZRC-20 ETH address.

When transferring to ZetaChain a no asset `gateway.call` is executed, because
cross-chain calls to ZetaChain do not require the sender to cover gas costs.

When transferring to another connected chain, `gateway.depositAndCall` is
executed with some gas tokens to cover the gas costs on the destination chain.

### Handling NFT Transfers

`onCall` is executed when an NFT transfer is received from a connected chain or
ZetaChain.

Since all cross-chain transactions go through a universal contract on ZetaChain,
`onCall` checks that the call is made from a trusted counterparty universal
contract address to prevent unauthorized minting.

### Revert Handling

If an NFT transfer from ZetaChain to a connected chain fails, `onRevert` is
called. `onRevert` mints the NFT and transfers it back to original sender.

## Start Localnet

[Localnet](/developers/tutorials/localnet) provides a simulated environment for
developing and testing ZetaChain contracts locally.

To start localnet, open a terminal window and run:

```bash
npx hardhat localnet
```

This command initializes a local blockchain environment that simulates the
behavior of ZetaChain protocol contracts.

## Demo

Run the following script, which will deploy NFT contracts on localnet, set
counterparty addresses, mint an NFT and transfer it ZetaChain → Ethereum → BNB →
ZetaChain:

```
./scripts/test.sh
```

On localnet Ethereum, BNB, and ZetaChain are all running on the same Anvil
blockchain, but each has its own Gateway, which allows us to simulate
cross-chain transfers.
