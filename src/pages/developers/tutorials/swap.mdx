title: Swap
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

In this tutorial, you will create a cross-chain swap contract. This contract
will enable users to exchange a native gas token or a supported ERC-20 token
from one connected blockchain for a token on another blockchain. For example, a
user will be able to swap USDC from Ethereum to BTC on Bitcoin in a single
transaction.

You will learn how to:

- Define a universal app contract that performs token swaps across chains.
- Deploy the contract to localnet.
- Interact with the contract by swapping tokens from a connected EVM blockchain
  in localnet.

The swap contract will be implemented as a universal app and deployed on
ZetaChain.

Universal apps can accept token transfers and contract calls from connected
chains. Tokens transferred from connected chains to a universal app contract are
represented as [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20). For example, ETH transferred
from Ethereum is represented as ZRC-20 ETH. ZRC-20 tokens have the unique
property of being able to be withdrawn back to their original chain as native
assets.

The swap contract will:

- Accept a contract call from a connected chain containing native gas or
  supported ERC-20 tokens and a message.
- Decode the message, which should include:
  - Target token address (represented as ZRC-20)
  - Recipient address on the destination chain
- Query withdraw gas fee of the target token.
- Swap a fraction of the input token for a ZRC-20 gas token to cover the
  withdrawal fee using the Uniswap v2 liquidity pools.
- Swap the remaining input token amount for the target token ZRC-20.
- Withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to the destination chain.

<Alert>This tutorial relies on the Gateway, which is currently available only on localnet and testnet.</Alert>

## Setting Up Your Environment

To set up your environment, clone the example contracts repository and install
the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts

cd example-contracts/examples/swap

yarn
```

## Understanding the Swap Contract

The `Swap` contract is a universal application that facilitates cross-chain
token swaps on ZetaChain. It inherits from the `UniversalContract` interface and
handles incoming cross-chain calls, processes token swaps using ZetaChain's
liquidity pools, and sends the swapped tokens to the recipient on the target
chain.

### Decoding the Message

The contract defines a `Params` struct to store two crucial pieces of
information:

- **`address target`**: The ZRC-20 address of the target token on ZetaChain.
- **`bytes to`**: The recipient's address on the destination chain, stored as
  `bytes` because the recipient could be on an EVM chain (like Ethereum or BNB)
  or on a non-EVM chain like Bitcoin.

When the `onCrossChainCall` function is invoked, it receives a `message`
parameter that needs to be decoded to extract the swap details. The encoding of
this message varies depending on the source chain due to different limitations
and requirements.

- **For Bitcoin**: Since Bitcoin has an upper limit of 80 bytes for OP_RETURN
  messages, the contract uses a more efficient encoding. It extracts the
  `params.target` by reading the first 20 bytes of the `message` and converting
  it to an `address` using the `bytesToAddress` helper method. The recipient's
  address is then obtained by reading the next 20 bytes and packing it into
  `bytes` using `abi.encodePacked`.

- **For EVM Chains And Solana**: EVM chains don't have strict message size
  limits, so the contract uses `abi.decode` to extract the `params.target` and
  `params.to` directly from the `message`.

The `context.chainID` is utilized to determine the source chain and apply the
appropriate decoding logic.

After decoding the message, the contract proceeds to handle the token swap and
withdrawal process by calling the `swapAndWithdraw` function with the
appropriate parameters.

### Swapping and Withdrawing Tokens

The `swapAndWithdraw` function encapsulates the logic for swapping tokens and
withdrawing them to the connected chain. By separating this logic into its own
function, the code becomes cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Swapping for Gas Token

The contract first addresses the gas fee required for the withdrawal on the
destination chain. It uses the `withdrawGasFee` method of the target token's
ZRC-20 contract to obtain the gas fee amount (`gasFee`) and the gas fee token
address (`gasZRC20`).

If the incoming token (`inputToken`) is the same as the gas fee token
(`gasZRC20`), it deducts the gas fee directly from the incoming amount.
Otherwise, it swaps a portion of the incoming tokens for the required gas fee
using the `swapTokensForExactTokens` helper method. This ensures that the
contract has enough gas tokens to cover the withdrawal fee on the destination
chain.

#### Swapping for Target Token

Next, the contract swaps the remaining tokens (`swapAmount`) for the target
token specified in `targetToken`. It uses the `swapExactTokensForTokens` helper
method to perform this swap through ZetaChain's internal liquidity pools. This
method returns the amount of the target token received (`outputAmount`).

#### Withdrawing Target Token to Connected Chain

At this stage, the contract holds the required gas fee in `gasZRC20` tokens and
the swapped target tokens in `targetToken`. It needs to approve the
`GatewayZEVM` contract to spend these tokens before initiating the withdrawal.
If the gas fee token is the same as the target token, it approves the total
amount (gas fee plus output amount) for the gateway to spend. If they are
different, it approves each token separatelyâ€”the gas fee token (`gasZRC20`) and
the target token (`targetToken`).

Finally, the contract calls the `gateway.withdraw` method to send the tokens to
the recipient on the connected chain. The `withdraw` method handles the
cross-chain transfer, ensuring that the recipient receives the swapped tokens on
their native chain, whether it's an EVM chain or Bitcoin.

<Alert>
  {" "}
  Note that you don't have to specify which chain to withdraw to because each ZRC-20 contract knows which connected chain
  it is associated with. For example, ZRC-20 Ethereum USDC can only be withdrawn to Ethereum.

## Swapping Gas Tokens for ERC-20 Tokens

To swap gas tokens for ERC-20 tokens, run the following command:

```
npx hardhat swap-from-evm --network localhost --receiver 0x84eA74d481Ee0A5332c457a4d796187F6Ba67fEB --amount 1 --target 0x9fd96203f7b22bCF72d9DCb40ff98302376cE09c --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

This script deposits tokens into the gateway on a connected EVM chain and sends
a message to the Swap contract on ZetaChain to execute the swap logic.

In this command, the `--receiver` parameter is the address of the Swap contract
on ZetaChain that will handle the swap. The `--amount 1` option indicates that
you want to swap 1 ETH. `--target` is the ZRC-20 address of the destination
token (in this example, it's ZRC-20 USDC).

When you execute this command, the script calls the `gateway.depositAndCall`
method on the connected EVM chain, depositing 1 ETH and sending a message to the
Swap contract on ZetaChain.

ZetaChain then picks up the event and executes the `onCrossChainCall` function
of the Swap contract with the provided message.

The Swap contract decodes the message, identifies the target ERC-20 token and
recipient, and initiates the swap logic.

Finally, the EVM chain receives the withdrawal request, and the swapped ERC-20
tokens are transferred to the recipient's address:

### Swapping ERC-20 Tokens for Gas Tokens

To swap ERC-20 tokens for gas tokens, adjust the command by specifying the
ERC-20 token you're swapping from using the `--erc20` parameter:

```
npx hardhat swap-from-evm --network localhost --receiver 0x84eA74d481Ee0A5332c457a4d796187F6Ba67fEB --amount 1 --target 0x2ca7d64A7EFE2D62A725E2B35Cf7230D6677FfEe --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 --erc20 0x0B306BF915C4d645ff596e518fAf3F9669b97016
```

Here, the `--erc20` option specifies the ERC-20 token address you're swapping
from on the source chain. The other parameters remain the same as in the
previous command.

When you run the command, the script calls the `gateway.depositAndCall` method
with the specified ERC-20 token and amount, sending a message to the Swap
contract on ZetaChain.

ZetaChain picks up the event and executes the `onCrossChainCall` function of the
Swap contract:

The Swap contract decodes the message, identifies the target gas token and
recipient, and initiates the swap logic.

The EVM chain then receives the withdrawal request, and the swapped gas tokens
are transferred to the recipient's address.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to define a universal app contract that
performs cross-chain token swaps. You deployed the `Swap` contract to a local
development network and interacted with the contract by swapping tokens from a
connected EVM chain. You also understood the mechanics of handling gas fees and
token approvals in cross-chain swaps.
