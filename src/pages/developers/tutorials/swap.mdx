title: Swap
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

In this tutorial, you will create a cross-chain swap contract. This contract
will enable users to exchange a native gas token or a supported ERC-20 token
from one connected blockchain for a token on another blockchain. For example, a
user will be able to swap USDC from Ethereum to BTC on Bitcoin in a single
transaction.

You will learn how to:

- Define a universal app contract that performs token swaps across chains.
- Deploy the contract to localnet.
- Interact with the contract by swapping tokens from a connected EVM blockchain
  in localnet.

The swap contract will be implemented as a universal app and deployed on
ZetaChain.

Universal apps can accept token transfers and contract calls from connected
chains. Tokens transferred from connected chains to a universal app contract are
represented as [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20). For example, ETH transferred
from Ethereum is represented as ZRC-20 ETH. ZRC-20 tokens have the unique
property of being able to be withdrawn back to their original chain as native
assets.

The swap contract will:

1. Accept a contract call from a connected chain containing native gas or
   supported ERC-20 tokens and a message.
2. Decode the message to extract:
   - The target token's address (represented as ZRC-20).
   - The recipient's address on the destination chain.
3. Query the withdrawal gas fee for the target token.
4. Swap part of the input token for ZRC-20 gas tokens to cover the withdrawal
   fee using Uniswap v2 liquidity pools.
5. Swap the remaining input token amount for the target ZRC-20 token.
6. Withdraw the ZRC-20 tokens to the destination chain.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To set up your environment, clone the example contracts repository and install
the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts

cd example-contracts/examples/swap

yarn
```

## Understanding the Swap Contract

The `Swap` contract is a universal application that facilitates cross-chain
token swaps on ZetaChain. It inherits from the `UniversalContract` interface and
handles incoming cross-chain calls, processes token swaps using ZetaChain's
liquidity pools, and sends the swapped tokens to the recipient on the target
chain.

### Decoding the Message

The contract uses a `Params` struct to store the following pieces of
information:

- **`address target`**: The ZRC-20 address of the target token on ZetaChain.
- **`bytes to`**: The recipient's address on the destination chain, stored as
  `bytes` to support both EVM chains (e.g., Ethereum, BNB) and non-EVM chains
  like Bitcoin.
- **`bool withdraw`**: Indicates whether to withdraw the swapped token to the
  destination chain or transfer it to the recipient on ZetaChain.

When the `onCall` function is invoked, it receives a `message` parameter that
must be decoded to extract the swap details. The decoding logic adapts to the
source chain's specific requirements and limitations.

- **For Bitcoin**: Due to Bitcoin's 80-byte OP_RETURN limit, the contract
  employs an efficient encoding method. The target token address
  (`params.target`) is extracted from the first 20 bytes of the `message`,
  converted into an `address` using a helper function. The recipient’s address
  is extracted from the next 20 bytes and encoded as `bytes` format.
- **For EVM Chains and Solana**: Without strict size limitations on messages,
  the contract uses `abi.decode` to extract all parameters directly.

The source chain is identified using the `context.chainID`, which determines the
appropriate decoding logic. After decoding, the contract proceeds to handle the
token swap by invoking `handleGasAndSwap` and, if required, initiating a
withdrawal.

---

### Handling Gas and Swapping Tokens

The `handleGasAndSwap` function handles both obtaining gas tokens for withdrawal
fees and swapping the remaining tokens for the target token.

The contract ensures sufficient gas tokens to cover the withdrawal fee on the
destination chain by calculating the required amount through the ZRC-20
contract's `withdrawGasFee` method. This method provides the fee amount
(`gasFee`) and the gas token address (`gasZRC20`).

If the incoming token is already the gas token, the required gas fee is deducted
directly. Otherwise, the contract swaps a portion of the incoming tokens for the
gas fee using a helper function. This ensures the contract is always prepared
for cross-chain withdrawal operations.

After addressing the gas fee, the remaining tokens are swapped for the target
token using ZetaChain's internal liquidity pools. This step ensures that the
recipient receives the correct token as specified in the `Params`.

### Withdrawing Target Token to Connected Chain

Once the gas and target tokens are prepared, the contract determines the
appropriate action based on the `withdraw` parameter:

- **If `withdraw` is `true`**: The target token and gas tokens are approved,
  either combined or separately depending on whether they are the same. The
  contract calls `gateway.withdraw` to transfer the tokens to the destination
  chain. The recipient's address is encoded using `abi.encodePacked`. The Swap
  contract is supplied as the revert address, while the sender's address and
  input token are included as a revert message for potential recovery. The
  ZRC-20 contract inherently ensures that tokens are withdrawn to the correct
  connected chain.
- **If `withdraw` is `false`**: The target token is transferred directly to the
  recipient on ZetaChain, bypassing the withdrawal process.

### Revert Logic

If a withdrawal fails on the destination chain, the `onRevert` function is
invoked to recover the funds. The sender's address and the original token are
decoded from the revert message, ensuring the correct data for recovery.

The contract swaps the reverted tokens back to the original token sent from the
source chain. Finally, it attempts to withdraw the tokens back to the source
chain. If this withdrawal also fails, the tokens are transferred directly to the
sender on ZetaChain. This approach minimizes the risk of lost funds and ensures
a robust fallback mechanism.

### Companion Contract

The Swap contract can be called in two ways:

1. **Directly via `depositAndCall`**: This method uses the EVM gateway on a
   connected chain, eliminating the need for an intermediary contract. It is
   suitable for straightforward swaps without additional logic on the connected
   chain.
2. **Through a companion contract**: This approach is useful when additional
   logic must be executed on the connected chain before initiating the swap. The
   tutorial provides an example of such a companion contract in
   `SwapCompanion.sol`.

## Swapping Gas Tokens for ERC-20 Tokens

To swap gas tokens for ERC-20 tokens, run the following command:

```
npx hardhat evm-swap \
  --network localhost \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

This script deposits tokens into the gateway on a connected EVM chain and sends
a message to the Swap contract on ZetaChain to execute the swap logic.

In this command, the `--receiver` parameter is the address of the Swap contract
on ZetaChain that will handle the swap. The `--amount 1` option indicates that
you want to swap 1 ETH. `--target` is the ZRC-20 address of the destination
token (in this example, it's ZRC-20 USDC).

When you execute this command, the script calls the `gateway.depositAndCall`
method on the connected EVM chain, depositing 1 ETH and sending a message to the
Swap contract on ZetaChain.

ZetaChain then picks up the event and executes the `onCall` function of the Swap
contract with the provided message.

The Swap contract decodes the message, identifies the target ERC-20 token and
recipient, and initiates the swap logic.

Finally, the EVM chain receives the withdrawal request, and the swapped ERC-20
tokens are transferred to the recipient's address:

### Swapping ERC-20 Tokens for Gas Tokens

To swap ERC-20 tokens for gas tokens, adjust the command by specifying the
ERC-20 token you're swapping from using the `--erc20` parameter:

```
npx hardhat evm-swap \
  --network localhost \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --erc20 0xE6E340D132b5f46d1e472DebcD681B2aBc16e57E
```

Here, the `--erc20` option specifies the ERC-20 token address you're swapping
from on the source chain. The other parameters remain the same as in the
previous command.

When you run the command, the script calls the `gateway.depositAndCall` method
with the specified ERC-20 token and amount, sending a message to the Swap
contract on ZetaChain.

ZetaChain picks up the event and executes the `onCall` function of the Swap
contract:

The Swap contract decodes the message, identifies the target gas token and
recipient, and initiates the swap logic.

The EVM chain then receives the withdrawal request, and the swapped gas tokens
are transferred to the recipient's address.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to define a universal app contract that
performs cross-chain token swaps. You deployed the `Swap` contract to a local
development network and interacted with the contract by swapping tokens from a
connected EVM chain. You also understood the mechanics of handling gas fees and
token approvals in cross-chain swaps.
