Localnet is a local development environment that simplifies the development of
universal apps.

Localnet:

- Starts an [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) local testnet node
- Deploys [protocol
  contracts](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/tree/main/v2) on
  the local testnet node. Both EVM gateway and ZetaChain gateway are deployed
  and running on the same local blockchain
- Simulates the real-world testnet environment of ZetaChain by observing events
  and and relaying the contract calls between EVM gateway and ZetaChain gateway
