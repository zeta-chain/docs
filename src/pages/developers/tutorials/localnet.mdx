Localnet is a local development environment that simplifies the development of
universal apps.

Localnet:

- Starts an [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) local testnet node
- Deploys [protocol
  contracts](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/tree/main/v2) on
  the local testnet node. Both EVM gateway and ZetaChain gateway are deployed
  and running on the same local blockchain
- Simulates the real-world testnet environment of ZetaChain by observing events
  and and relaying the contract calls between EVM gateway and ZetaChain gateway

Clone the example contracts repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts
cd universal/hello
yarn
```

Start the localnet:

```
yarn hardhat localnet
```

Once the localnet is started you will see the standard Anvil output with a list
of accounts, private keys as well as the output from protocol contracts being
deployed. After the localnet is set up you will see a list of protocol contract
addresses:

```
EVM Contract Addresses
======================

Gateway EVM: 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0
ZETA:        0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3

ZetaChain Contract Addresses
============================

Gateway ZetaChain: 0x610178dA211FEF7D417bC0e6FeD39F05609AD788
ZETA:              0xa513E6E4b8f2a923D98304ec87F64353C4D5C853
ZRC-20 ETH:        0x9fd96203f7b22bCF72d9DCb40ff98302376cE09c
```

Keep the terminal window with localnet running open and open a new terminal.

Compile the contracts and deploy both a Hello universal app contract and a
Receiver contract.

```
yarn deploy
```

Universal app contract address:

```
ðŸš€ Successfully deployed contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x0DCd1Bf9A1b36cE34237eEaFef220932846BCD82
```

Receiver contract:

```
ðŸš€ Successfully deployed contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x9A676e781A523b5d0C0e43731313A708CB607508
```

Even though both contracts are deployed on the same local testnet we will think
of Hello as running on ZetaChain and Receiver as running on a generic EVM chain.
These two contracts are connected with each other through the
[gateway](/developers/evm/gateway).
