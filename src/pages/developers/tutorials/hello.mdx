title: Your First Univeral App
---

In this tutorial you will create a simple universal app contract that accepts a
message with a string and emits an event with that string when called from a
connected chain. For example, a user on Ethereum will be able to send a message
"alice" and the universal contract on ZetaChain will emit a "Greet" event with a
value "alice".

You will learn how to:

- Use the Hardhat template to create a new universal app using a single command
- Define you universal app contract to handle messages from connected chains
- Deploy the contract to ZetaChain
- Interact with the contract by sending a message from Ethereum testnet
- Track an incoming cross-chain transaction

## Prerequisites

- [Introduction to Universal Apps](/developers/apps/intro/)
- [Interacting with a Universal App](/developers/apps/interacting/)
- [Getting Started](/developers/tutorials/start)

## Set Up Your Environment

Clone the Hardhat contract template:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/template

cd template

yarn
```

Make sure that you've followed the [Getting
Started](/developers/tutorials/start) tutorial to set up your development
environment, create an account and request testnet tokens.

## Create the Contract

To create a new universal app contract, use the `omnichain` Hardhat task:

```
npx hardhat omnichain Greeting name
```

The `omnichain` task accepts a contract name (`Greeting`) and a list of fields.
The list of fields defines the values that will be included in the message
passed to a universal app contract.

A field may have a type specified after the field name, separated by a colon. If
no type is specified, the type defaults to `string`.

Supported types are: `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, `string`,
`int`,`int8`,`int16`,`int128`,`int256`,`uint`,`uint8`,`uint16`,`uint128`,`uint256`.

In this example the message will contain only one value: `name` of type
`string`.

The `omnichain` task has created:

- `contracts/Greeting.sol`: a Solidity universal app contract
- `tasks/deploy.ts`: a Hardhat task to deploy the contract
- `tasks/interact.ts`: a Hardhat task to interact with the contract

It also modified `hardhat.config.ts` to import both `deploy` and `interact`
tasks.

## Universal App Contract

Let's review the contents of the `Greeting` contract:

```solidity filename="contracts/Greeting.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/SystemContract.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol";
import "@zetachain/toolkit/contracts/OnlySystem.sol";

contract Greeting is zContract, OnlySystem {
    SystemContract public systemContract;

    constructor(address systemContractAddress) {
        systemContract = SystemContract(systemContractAddress);
    }

    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override onlySystem(systemContract) {
        (string memory name) = abi.decode(
            message,
            (string)
        );
        // TODO: implement the logic
    }
}
```

`Greeting` is a simple contract that inherits from the [`zContract`
interface](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol).

The contract declares a state variable of type `SystemContract` that stores a
reference to the [system contract](/developers/evm/system-contract).

The constructor function accepts the address of the system contract and stores
it in the `systemContract` state variable.

`onCrossChainCall` is a function that is called when the contract gets called by
a token transfer transaction sent to the TSS address on a connected chain (when
a gas token is deposited) or a `deposit` method call on the ERC-20 custody
contract (when an ERC-20 token is deposited). The function receives the
following inputs:

- `context`: is a struct of type
  [`zContext`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol)
  that contains the following values:
  - `origin`: EOA address that sent the token transfer transaction to the TSS
    address (triggering the omnichain contract) or the value passed to the
    `deposit` method call on the ERC-20 custody contract.
  - `chainID`: interger ID of the connected chain from which the omnichain
    contract was triggered.
  - `sender` (reserved for future use, currently empty)
- `zrc20`: the address of the ZRC-20 token contract that represents an asset
  from a connected chain on ZetaChain.
- `amount`: the amount of tokens that were transferred to the TSS address or an
  amount of tokens that were deposited to the ERC-20 custody contract.
- `message`: the contents of the `data` field of the token transfer transaction.

The `onCrossChainCall` function should only be called by the system contract (in
other words, by the ZetaChain protocol) to prevent a caller from supplying
arbitrary values in `context`. The `onlySystem` modifier ensures that the
function is called only as a response to a token transfer transaction sent to
the TSS address or an ERC-20 custody contract.

By default, the `onCrossChainCall` function doesn't do anything else. You will
implement the logic yourself based on your use case.

Modify the contract to emit an event after parsing the `message`:

```solidity filename="contracts/Greeting.sol" {10,26}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/SystemContract.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol";
import "@zetachain/toolkit/contracts/OnlySystem.sol";

contract Greeting is zContract, OnlySystem {
    SystemContract public systemContract;
    event Greet(string message);

    constructor(address systemContractAddress) {
        systemContract = SystemContract(systemContractAddress);
    }

    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override onlySystem(systemContract) {
        (string memory name) = abi.decode(
            message,
            (string)
        );
        emit Greet(name);
    }
}
```

## Deploy Task

The `omnichain` task has created a Hardhat task to deploy the contract:

```ts filename="tasks/deploy.ts"
import { getAddress, ParamChainName } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";
import { task } from "hardhat/config";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const network = hre.network.name as ParamChainName;

  if (!/zeta_(testnet|mainnet)/.test(network)) {
    throw new Error('🚨 Please use either "zeta_testnet" or "zeta_mainnet" network to deploy to ZetaChain.');
  }

  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  if (signer === undefined) {
    throw new Error(
      `Wallet not found. Please, run "npx hardhat account --save" or set PRIVATE_KEY env variable (for example, in a .env file)`
    );
  }

  const systemContract = getAddress("systemContract", network);

  const factory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(args.name);
  const contract = await factory.deploy(systemContract);
  await contract.deployed();

  const isTestnet = network === "zeta_testnet";
  const zetascan = isTestnet ? "athens.explorer" : "explorer";
  const blockscout = isTestnet ? "zetachain-athens-3" : "zetachain";

  if (args.json) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(contract));
  } else {
    console.log(`🔑 Using account: ${signer.address}

🚀 Successfully deployed contract on ${network}.
📜 Contract address: ${contract.address}
🌍 ZetaScan: https://${zetascan}.zetachain.com/address/${contract.address}
🌍 Blockcsout: https://${blockscout}.blockscout.com/address/${contract.address}
`);
  }
};

task("deploy", "Deploy the contract", main)
  .addFlag("json", "Output in JSON")
  .addOptionalParam("name", "Contract to deploy", "Greeting");
```

Omnichain contracts are supposed to be deployed to ZetaChain, so the task checks
that the `--network` flag value is always `zeta_testnet`.

The task uses the `getAddress` function from `@zetachain/protocol-contracts` to
get the address of the system contract on ZetaChain.

The task then uses Ethers.js to deploy the contract to ZetaChain.

## Interact Task

The `omnichain` task has also created a Hardhat task to interact with the
contract:

```ts filename="tasks/interact.ts"
import { task } from "hardhat/config";
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
import { parseUnits } from "@ethersproject/units";
import { getAddress } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";
import ERC20Custody from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/abi/evm/ERC20Custody.sol/ERC20Custody.json";
import { prepareData } from "@zetachain/toolkit/client";
import { utils, ethers } from "ethers";
import ERC20 from "@openzeppelin/contracts/build/contracts/ERC20.json";

const main = async (args: any, hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) => {
  const [signer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();

  const data = prepareData(args.contract, ["string"], [args.name]);

  let tx;

  if (args.token) {
    const custodyAddress = getAddress("erc20Custody", hre.network.name as any);
    if (!custodyAddress) {
      throw new Error(`No ERC20 Custody contract found for ${hre.network.name} network`);
    }

    const custodyContract = new ethers.Contract(custodyAddress, ERC20Custody.abi, signer);
    const tokenContract = new ethers.Contract(args.token, ERC20.abi, signer);
    const decimals = await tokenContract.decimals();
    const value = parseUnits(args.amount, decimals);
    const approve = await tokenContract.approve(custodyAddress, value);
    await approve.wait();

    tx = await custodyContract.deposit(signer.address, args.token, value, data);
    tx.wait();
  } else {
    const value = parseUnits(args.amount, 18);
    const to = getAddress("tss", hre.network.name as any);
    tx = await signer.sendTransaction({ data, to, value });
  }

  if (args.json) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(tx, null, 2));
  } else {
    console.log(`🔑 Using account: ${signer.address}\n`);

    console.log(`🚀 Successfully broadcasted a token transfer transaction on ${hre.network.name} network.
📝 Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}
  `);
  }
};

task("interact", "Interact with the contract", main)
  .addParam("contract", "The address of the withdraw contract on ZetaChain")
  .addParam("amount", "Amount of tokens to send")
  .addOptionalParam("token", "The address of the token to send")
  .addFlag("json", "Output in JSON")
  .addParam("name");
```

The task uses the `prepareData` function from `@zetachain/toolkit/helpers` to
prepare the `data` field of the token transfer transaction. `prepareData`
accepts an omnichain contract address on ZetaChain, a list of argument types,
and a list of argument names. The `data` field contains the following
information:

- the address of the contract on ZetaChain
- the arguments to pass to the `onCrossChainCall` function in the `message`
  parameter

In the code generated above there are no arguments, so the `data` field is
simply the address of the contract on ZetaChain.

Calling omnichain contracts is differs depending on whether a gas token is being
deposited or an ERC-20 token.

If an ERC-20 token address is passed to the `--token` optional parameter, the
interact task assumes you want to deposit an ERC-20 token in an omnichain
contract.

To deposit an ERC-20 token into an omnichain contract you need to call the
`deposit` method of the ERC-20 custody contract. The task first gets the address
of the custody contract on the current network, creates an instance of a token
contract, gets the number of decimals of the token, and approves the custody
contract to spend the specified amount of ERC-20 tokens. The task then calls the
`deposit` method of the custody contract, passing the following information:

- `signer.address`: the sender address that will be available in the `origin`
  field of the `context` parameter of the `onCrossChainCall` function
- `args.token`: the address of the ERC-20 token being deposited
- `value`: the amount of tokens being deposited
- `data`: the contents of the `message`

If the `--token` optional parameter is not used, the interact task assumes you
want to deposit a gas token. To deposit a gas token you need to send a token
transfer transaction to the TSS address on a connected chain.

`getAddress` retrieves the address of the TSS on the current network.

The task then uses Ethers.js to send a token transfer transaction to the TSS
address. The transaction contains the following information:

- `data`: the `data` field prepared by `prepareData`
- `to`: the address of the TSS
- `value`: the amount of tokens to transfer

## Deploy the Contract

Compile the contract:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Use the `--force` flag to clear the cache and artifacts.

Deploy the contract to ZetaChain:

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet
```

```

## Interact with the Contract

Use the `interact` task to send a transaction on Ethereum Sepolia testnet:

```
npx hardhat interact --name alice --contract 0x2C0201B9DFdC6Dcc23524Ab29c51c38dcc8afF54 --network sepolia_testnet --amount 0
```

```

```

The `interact` task has sent a transaction to the TSS address on Sepolia.

The `data` field of the transaction contains the following data:

```
0x2c0201b9dfdc6dcc23524ab29c51c38dcc8aff5400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005616c696365000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The first 20 bytes is the universal app contract on ZetaChain, the rest are
bytes that will be passed to the universal contract as `message`. In this
example, the `message` is a string `alice`.

The `value` (amount) of the transaction is 0, because you're not sending any ETH
in this example, you're just sending a message.

Track the transaction:

```
npx hardhat cctx 0x1d32177e6cdedbabd5f587ed0de80e8b4734636b329d88d24d015676257c330d
