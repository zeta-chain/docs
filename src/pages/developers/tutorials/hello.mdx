In this tutorial, you will create a simple Universal App on ZetaChain. This app
will emit an event when it receives a cross-chain call from a connected chain.

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to:

- Build a basic Universal App
- Deploy it on ZetaChain Localnet
- Use a Gateway on a connected chain to call your Universal App

## Set Up Your Environment

Start by creating a new project and installing dependencies:

```bash
npx zetachain@latest new --project hello
cd hello
yarn
```

## Universal Contract

A Universal App is a contract that implements the `UniversalContract` interface.

```solidity filename="contracts/Universal.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/GatewayZEVM.sol";

contract Universal is UniversalContract {
    GatewayZEVM public immutable gateway;

    event HelloEvent(string, string);
    error Unauthorized();

    modifier onlyGateway() {
        if (msg.sender != address(gateway)) revert Unauthorized();
        _;
    }

    constructor(address payable gatewayAddress) {
        gateway = GatewayZEVM(gatewayAddress);
    }

    function onCall(
        MessageContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external override onlyGateway {
        string memory name = abi.decode(message, (string));
        emit HelloEvent("Hello: ", name);
    }
}
```

The constructor takes ZetaChain’s Gateway address and stores it in a state
variable. The Gateway is used for making outbound contract calls and token
withdrawals.

A universal contract must implement the `onCall` function. This function is
triggered when the contract receives a call from a connected chain via the
Gateway. The function processes incoming data, which includes:

- `context`: A `MessageContext` struct containing:
  - `chainID`: The chain ID of the connected chain that initiated the
    cross-chain call.
  - `sender`: The address (EOA or contract) that called the Gateway on the
    connected chain.
  - `origin`: Deprecated.
- `zrc20`: The address of the ZRC-20 token representing assets from the source
  chain.
- `amount`: The amount of tokens transferred.
- `message`: The encoded payload data.

In this example, `onCall` decodes the message into a string and emits an event.

`onCall` should only be called by the Gateway to ensure that it is only called
as a response to a call on a connected chain and that you can trust the values
of the function parameters.

## Option 1: Deploy on Localnet

[Localnet](/reference/localnet) is a local development environment that
simulates multiple connected EVM chains with Gateways.

Start Localnet:

```
npx zetachain localnet start
```

Compile your contracts:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

To deploy a universal contract, you need the Gateway address from Localnet. You
can either copy it from the output or fetch it programmatically:

```
GATEWAY_ZETACHAIN=$(jq -r '.["31337"].contracts[] | select(.contractType == "gateway") | .address' ~/.zetachain/localnet/registry.json) && echo $GATEWAY_ZETACHAIN
```

Deploy the universal contract and provide the Gateway address in the
constructor:

```
UNIVERSAL=$(npx hardhat deploy --network localhost --gateway "$GATEWAY_ZETACHAIN" --json | jq -r .contractAddress) && echo $UNIVERSAL
```

### Make a Call to the Universal App

To call the universal app deployed on ZetaChain from a connected chain, send a
transaction to the Gateway contract on the connected EVM chain.

Fetch the Gateway address for the connected chain:

```
GATEWAY_EVM=$(jq -r '.["11155112"].contracts[] | select(.contractType == "gateway") | .address' ~/.zetachain/localnet/registry.json)
```

Alternatively, you can copy the Gateway address directly from the table printed
in the Localnet terminal output when Localnet starts.

Fetch a private key with pre-funded tokens on the connected chain:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=$(jq -r '.private_keys[0]' ~/.zetachain/localnet/anvil.json)
```

Execute the `call` method on the connected chain’s Gateway to send a message to
the universal contract deployed on ZetaChain.

```
npx zetachain evm call \
  --rpc http://localhost:8545 \
  --gateway $GATEWAY_EVM \
  --receiver $UNIVERSAL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --types string \
  --values hello
```

Once the transaction is processed, you’ll see an `[ZetaChain]: Event from onCall` log in the Localnet terminal.

## Option 2: Deploy on Testnet

Set your private key in the `.env` file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

Deploy the contract to ZetaChain’s testnet using the Gateway address from the
[Contract Addresses page](/reference/network/contracts/):

```
UNIVERSAL=$(npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet --gateway 0x6c533f7fe93fae114d0954697069df33c9b74fd7 --json | jq -r .contractAddress) && echo $UNIVERSAL
```

Make a transaction to the Gateway on Base Sepolia (or another connected testnet)
to call the universal app on ZetaChain.

```
npx zetachain evm call \
  --chain-id 84532 \
  --receiver $UNIVERSAL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --types string \
  --values hello
```

```

Track the status of the cross-chain transaction:

```
npx zetachain query cctx --hash 0x89308870b0863c5ae48dc783059277cbcf4296b1b343413ac543418262a4ccbc
