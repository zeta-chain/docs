title: Your First Universal App
---

In this tutorial, you will create a simple universal app contract that accepts a
message with a string and emits an event with that string when called from a
connected chain. For example, a user on Ethereum will be able to send a message
"alice" and the universal contract on ZetaChain will emit an event with the
string "Hello on ZetaChain, alice".

You will learn how to:

- Define your universal app contract to handle messages from connected chains.
- Deploy the contract to localnet.
- Interact with the contract by sending a message from a connected EVM
  blockchain in localnet.
- Handle reverts gracefully by implementing revert logic.

## Prerequisites

- [Introduction to Universal Apps](/developers/apps/intro/)
- [Getting Started](/developers/tutorials/intro)

## Set Up Your Environment

Clone the example contracts repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts

cd example-contracts/examples/hello

yarn
```

## Universal App Contract

Let's review the contents of the `Hello` contract:

```solidity filename="contracts/Hello.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import {RevertContext, RevertOptions} from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/Revert.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/UniversalContract.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/IGatewayZEVM.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/GatewayZEVM.sol";

contract Hello is UniversalContract {
    GatewayZEVM public gateway;

    event HelloEvent(string, string);
    event RevertEvent(string, RevertContext);

    constructor(address payable gatewayAddress) {
        gateway = GatewayZEVM(gatewayAddress);
    }

    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external override {
        string memory name = abi.decode(message, (string));
        emit HelloEvent("Hello on ZetaChain", name);
    }

    function onRevert(RevertContext calldata revertContext) external override {
        emit RevertEvent("Revert on EVM", revertContext);
    }
}
```

`Hello` is a simple contract that inherits from the [`UniversalContract`
interface](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/v2/contracts/zevm/interfaces/UniversalContract.sol),
which defines the required functions for cross-chain communication.

The contract declares a state variable of type `GatewayZEVM` that stores a
reference to the ZetaChain's gateway contract.

The constructor function accepts the address of the ZetaChain gateway contract
and initializes the `gateway` state variable.

`onCrossChainCall` is a function that is executed when the contract is called
from a connected chain through a gateway. The function receives the following
inputs:

- `context`: is a struct of type
  [`zContext`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol)
  that contains the following values:
  - `origin`: EOA or contract caller address that called the gateway on a
    connected chain.
  - `chainID`: integer ID of the connected chain from which the omnichain
    contract was triggered.
  - `sender` (reserved for future use, currently empty)
- `zrc20`: the address of the ZRC-20 token contract that represents an asset
  from a connected chain on ZetaChain.
- `amount`: the amount of tokens that were sent to the universal app
- `message`: the contents of the `data` field of the token transfer transaction.

The `onCrossChainCall` function should only be called by the ZetaChain protocol
to prevent a caller from supplying arbitrary values in `context`.

`onCrossChainCall` decodes the `name` from the `message` and emits an event.

## Understanding the `Revert` Contract

The `Revert` contract is used to handle reverts that occur on ZetaChain and
allows you to define custom logic for such cases.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import {RevertContext} from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/Revert.sol";

contract Revert {
    event RevertEvent(string, RevertContext);
    event HelloEvent(string, string);

    function hello(string memory message) external {
        emit HelloEvent("Hello on EVM", message);
    }

    function onRevert(RevertContext calldata revertContext) external {
        emit RevertEvent("Revert on EVM", revertContext);
    }

    receive() external payable {}

    fallback() external payable {}
}
```

## Start Localnet

[Localnet](/developers/tutorials/localnet) is a development environment that
simulates the behavior of ZetaChain protocol contracts on a single local
blockchain.

Start localnet by running:

```
npx hardhat localnet
```

## Deploy the Contract

Compile the contracts and deploy them to localnet: s

```
npx run deploy
```

You should see output similar to:

```
ðŸ”‘ Using account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

ðŸš€ Successfully deployed "Hello" contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933

ðŸ”‘ Using account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

ðŸš€ Successfully deployed "Revert" contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0xE6E340D132b5f46d1e472DebcD681B2aBc16e57E
```

## Interact with the Contract

Use the `evm-call` script to execute the `gateway.call` method on the connected
EVM chain. This method sends a message to the `Hello` contract on ZetaChain.

```
npx hardhat evm-call --receiver 0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933 --network localhost --types '["string"]' alice
```

Parameters:

- `--receiver`: The address of the `Hello` contract on ZetaChain.
- `--types`: The ABI types of the message parameters.
- `alice`: The message to send.

The EVM gateway processes the call and emits a "Called" event.

```
[EVM]: Gateway: 'Called' event emitted
```

ZetaChain picks up the event and executes the `onCrossChainCall` function of the
`Hello` contract.

```text

```

The `Hello` contract decodes the message and emits a `HelloEvent`.

```

```

## Simulating a Revert

To demonstrate how reverts are handled, we'll intentionally cause a revert by
sending unexpected data. Instead of a `string`, we'll send a `uint256`.

```
npx hardhat evm-call --receiver 0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933 --network localhost --types '["uint256"]' 42
```

This will cause the `abi.decode` function in the `onCrossChainCall` to fail,
triggering a revert.

```
[EVM]: Gateway: 'Called' event emitted
```

```
[ZetaChain]: Universal contract 0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933 executing onCrossChainCall (context: {"origin":"0xA51c1fc2f0D1a1b8494Ed1FE312d7C3a78Ed91C0","sender":"0x735b14BB79463307AAcBED86DAf3322B1e6226aB","chainID":1}), zrc20: 0x91d18e54DAf4F677cB28167158d6dd21F6aB3921, amount: 0, message: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a)
```

You'll see output indicating that an error occurred:

```
[ZetaChain]: Error executing onCrossChainCall: Error: transaction execution reverted (action="sendTransaction", data=null, reason=null, invocation=null, revert=null, transaction={ "data": "", "from": "0x735b14BB79463307AAcBED86DAf3322B1e6226aB", "to": "0xA51c1fc2f0D1a1b8494Ed1FE312d7C3a78Ed91C0" }, receipt={ "_type": "TransactionReceipt", "blobGasPrice": "1", "blobGasUsed": null, "blockHash": "0x18c7286736278b0fbb987115176dfa42cd77cf9ec224914a37f43694fc506189", "blockNumber": 48, "contractAddress": null, "cumulativeGasUsed": "36569", "from": "0x735b14BB79463307AAcBED86DAf3322B1e6226aB", "gasPrice": "10000000000", "gasUsed": "36569", "hash": "0x7367af3912dc16d52cf29bd7e7c005fe3bec090e360108c69db7b57a8aec4262", "index": 0, "logs": [  ], "logsBloom": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "root": "0xbf1838bfa460082241895d67c8789e5f7ecc0729e88965abe1eaed1ed77ba66d", "status": 0, "to": "0xA51c1fc2f0D1a1b8494Ed1FE312d7C3a78Ed91C0" }, code=CALL_EXCEPTION, version=6.13.2)
```

Since we didn't specify a revert address, the gateway on the EVM chain cannot
handle the revert properly:

```

```

## Handling the Revert

To handle the revert gracefully, we'll provide additional parameters to specify
that the gateway should call the `Revert` contract on the source chain in case
of a revert.

```
npx hardhat evm-call --receiver 0x67d269191c92Caf3cD7723F116c85e6E9bf55933 --call-on-revert --revert-address 0xE6E340D132b5f46d1e472DebcD681B2aBc16e57E --network localhost --types '["uint256"]' 42
```

Parameters:

- `--call-on-revert`: Informs the gateway to handle reverts.
- `--revert-address`: The address of the `Revert` contract on the source chain.

```
[EVM]: Gateway: 'Called' event emitted
```

```

```

You'll now see that the `Revert` contract's `onRevert` function is called:

```

```

```
[EVM]: Gateway: successfully called onRevert
```

The `Revert` contract emits an event:

```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you:

- Learned how to define a universal app contract that handles cross-chain
  messages.
- Deployed the `Hello` and `Revert` contracts to a local development network.
- Interacted with the `Hello` contract by sending messages from a connected EVM
  chain.
