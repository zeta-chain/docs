By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to:

- Build a universal app that emits an event when called from a connected chain
- Deploy the universal app on localnet
- Use the Gateway on a connected chain to call a universal app

## Set Up Your Environment

Start by cloning the example contracts repository and installing the necessary
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts
cd example-contracts/examples/hello
yarn
```

## Universal Contract

A universal app is a contract that inherits from `UniversalContract` interface.

```solidity filename="contracts/Universal.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/GatewayZEVM.sol";

contract Universal is UniversalContract {
    GatewayZEVM public immutable gateway;

    event HelloEvent(string, string);

    modifier onlyGateway() {
        require(msg.sender == address(gateway), "Caller is not the gateway");
        _;
    }

    constructor(address payable gatewayAddress) {
        gateway = GatewayZEVM(gatewayAddress);
    }

    function onCall(
        MessageContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external override onlyGateway {
        string memory name = abi.decode(message, (string));
        emit HelloEvent("Hello: ", name);
    }
}
```

A universal contract must implement the `onCall` function. `onCall` is a
function that gets triggered when the contract receives a call from a connected
chain through the Gateway. This function processes the incoming data, which
includes:

- `context`: A `MessageContext` struct containing:
  - `chainID`: The integer ID of the connected chain from which the cross-chain
    call originated.
  - `sender`: The address (EOA or contract) that initiated the gateway call on
    the connected chain.
  - `origin`: deprecated.
- `zrc20`: The address of the ZRC-20 token representing the asset from the
  source chain.
- `amount`: The number of tokens transferred.
- `message`: The encoded data payload.

In this example, `onCall` simply decodes the message into a variable and emits
an event.

`onCall` should only be called by the Gateway to ensure that it is only called
as a response to a call on a connected chain and that you can trust the values
of the function parameters.

## Options 1: Deploy on Localnet

[Localnet](/developers/tutorials/localnet) is a local development environment,
which simulates the behavior of Gateways deployed on multiple EVM blockchains.
Start localnet:

```
npx hardhat localnet
```

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Deploy the universal contract and pass ZetaChain's Gateway address to the
constructor. You can find the Gateway address in the output of Localnet.

```
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost --gateway 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707
```

```

```

## Make a Call to the Universal App

To call the universal app deployed on ZetaChain from a connected chain, make a
call to the Gateway contract on a connected EVM chain using the `evm-call` task:

```
npx hardhat evm-call \
  --network localhost \
  --gateway-evm 0x610178dA211FEF7D417bC0e6FeD39F05609AD788 \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

Pass the EVM Gateway Address from the Localnet's table of addresses and the
universal contract address as the receiver. A universal app expects to receive a
single string in the message, so pass the appropriate type and value to the
command.

After the transaction is processed you will see an `[ZetaChain]: Event from onCall` message in the terminal where Localnet is running.

## Option 2: Deploy on Testnet

Deploy the contract to ZetaChain's testnet using the Gateway address from
[`Contract Addresses page`](/reference/network/contracts/).

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet --gateway 0x6c533f7fe93fae114d0954697069df33c9b74fd7
```

```

```

Make a transaction to the Gateway on the Base Sepolia testnet to make a
cross-chain call to the universal app on ZetaChain. Make sure to use Gateway
address on Base Sepolia.

```
npx hardhat evm-call \
  --network base_sepolia \
  --gateway-evm 0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995 \
  --receiver 0x11998e1A5D2e770753263376ceE78B14c9617f16 \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

```
