In this tutorial you will create a simple universal app deployed on ZetaChain,
which emits when called from a connected chain.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to:

- Build a simple universal app
- Deploy the universal app on localnet
- Use the Gateway on a connected chain to call a universal app

## Set Up Your Environment

Start by creating a project and installing the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npx zetachain@latest new --project hello
cd hello
yarn
```

## Universal Contract

A universal app is a contract that inherits from `UniversalContract` interface.

```solidity filename="contracts/Universal.sol"
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/GatewayZEVM.sol";

contract Universal is UniversalContract {
    GatewayZEVM public immutable gateway;

    event HelloEvent(string, string);
    error Unauthorized();

    modifier onlyGateway() {
        if (msg.sender != address(gateway)) revert Unauthorized();
        _;
    }

    constructor(address payable gatewayAddress) {
        gateway = GatewayZEVM(gatewayAddress);
    }

    function onCall(
        MessageContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external override onlyGateway {
        string memory name = abi.decode(message, (string));
        emit HelloEvent("Hello: ", name);
    }
}
```

The constructor accepts the ZetaChain's Gateway address and saves it into a
state variable. Gateway is used to make outgoing contract calls and token
withdrawals.

A universal contract must implement the `onCall` function. `onCall` is a
function that gets triggered when the contract receives a call from a connected
chain through the Gateway. This function processes the incoming data, which
includes:

- `context`: A `MessageContext` struct containing:
  - `chainID`: The integer ID of the connected chain from which the cross-chain
    call originated.
  - `sender`: The address (EOA or contract) that initiated the gateway call on
    the connected chain.
  - `origin`: deprecated.
- `zrc20`: The address of the ZRC-20 token representing the asset from the
  source chain.
- `amount`: The number of tokens transferred.
- `message`: The encoded data payload.

In this example, `onCall` simply decodes the message into a variable and emits
an event.

`onCall` should only be called by the Gateway to ensure that it is only called
as a response to a call on a connected chain and that you can trust the values
of the function parameters.

## Options 1: Deploy on Localnet

[Localnet](/developers/tutorials/localnet) is a local development environment,
which simulates the behavior of Gateways deployed on multiple EVM blockchains.
Start localnet:

```
yarn zetachain localnet start
```

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

Deploy the universal contract and pass ZetaChain's Gateway address to the
constructor. You can find the Gateway address in the output of Localnet.

```
npx hardhat deploy --network localhost --gateway 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707
```

```
ðŸš€ Successfully deployed "Universal" contract on localhost.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7
```

## Make a Call to the Universal App

To call the universal app deployed on ZetaChain from a connected chain, make a
call to the Gateway contract on a connected EVM chain using the `evm-call` task:

```
npx hardhat evm-call \
  --network localhost \
  --gateway-evm 0xA51c1fc2f0D1a1b8494Ed1FE312d7C3a78Ed91C0 \
  --receiver 0x8198f5d8F8CfFE8f9C413d98a0A55aEB8ab9FbB7 \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

Pass the EVM Gateway Address from the Localnet's table of addresses and the
universal contract address as the receiver. A universal app expects to receive a
single string in the message, so pass the appropriate type and value to the
command.

After the transaction is processed you will see an `[ZetaChain]: Event from onCall` message in the terminal where Localnet is running.

## Option 2: Deploy on Testnet

Before proceeding, you might want to check out the [Testnet
Setup](/developers/tutorials/testnet) guide to learn how to set up an account
and request testnet tokens.

Deploy the contract to ZetaChain's testnet using the Gateway address from
[`Contract Addresses page`](/reference/network/contracts/).

```
npx hardhat deploy --network zeta_testnet --gateway 0x6c533f7fe93fae114d0954697069df33c9b74fd7
```

```
ðŸ”‘ Using account: 0x4955a3F38ff86ae92A914445099caa8eA2B9bA32

ðŸš€ Successfully deployed "Universal" contract on zeta_testnet.
ðŸ“œ Contract address: 0x11998e1A5D2e770753263376ceE78B14c9617f16
```

Make a transaction to the Gateway on the Base Sepolia testnet to make a
cross-chain call to the universal app on ZetaChain. Make sure to use Gateway
address on Base Sepolia.

```
npx hardhat evm-call \
  --network base_sepolia \
  --gateway-evm 0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995 \
  --receiver 0x11998e1A5D2e770753263376ceE78B14c9617f16 \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

```

You can track the progress of a cross-chain transaction using ZetaChain's API:
