ZetaChain is a blockchain designed for universal appsâ€”smart contracts on the
ZetaChain EVM that are natively connected to other blockchains like Ethereum,
BNB, Solana, and Bitcoin.

A universal app can accept incoming contract calls, messages, and token
transfers from connected chains and initiate outgoing transactions to those
chains.

Each chain, including ZetaChain, has a Gateway. On ZetaChain and EVM chains, the
Gateway is a smart contract; on Solana, it is a program; and on Bitcoin, it is
an address. All interactions with universal apps happen through Gateways.

ZetaChain acts as a hub in the hub-spoke-model and developers build universal
apps that can orchestrate cross-chain transactions. This architecture allows
most of the app's logic to be encapsulated in a single universal contract.

## Native Token Transfer

Universal apps can accept transfers of supported native tokens from connected
chains. For example, native USDC can be transferred (deposited) from Ethereum
through the Gateway to a universal app on ZetaChain. Assets transferred from
connected chains are represented as ZRC-20 tokens on ZetaChain. A ZRC-20 token
can be transferred back (withdrawn) to its origin chain as a native asset. To
facilitate native token transfers ZetaChain validators maintain custody of
tokens on every connected chain. Tokens get locked in the custody when being
transferred to ZetaChain and get unlocked when being transferred from ZetaChain.

There are ZRC-20 liquidity pools on ZetaChain, which can be used by universal
apps to swap between ZRC-20s and other tokens, to acquire ZRC-20 to pay for gas
for outgoing transactions and by the ZetaChain protocol to handle gas when
processing reverts.

## Gas Fees

Making an incoming call or a deposit to a universal app only costs a gas fee on
the connected chain from which the call is made. Execution of universal apps is
free when called from a connected chain.

Making an outgoing call or a withdrawal from a universal app costs a gas fee on
the destination chain. The Gateway charges a universal app making a call in
ZRC-20 token. To cover the gas fee a universal app can swap tokens
