Interacting with ZetaChain universal apps from the Sui blockchain includes the
This tutorial demonstrates how to withdraw tokens to Sui while calling a Sui
contract in the same transactionâ€”enabling seamless cross-chain operations and
powerful DeFi flows.

You'll learn how to:

- Set up a localnet environment with ZetaChain and Sui
- Deploy and configure a Sui contract that responds to ZetaChain calls
- Execute withdrawAndCall() to send tokens and trigger contract logic on Sui

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed and configured the following tools before starting:

- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/references/cli): Required for starting a local
  Sui node and interacting with it.
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/): Needed for encoding payload data using ABI.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Required for parsing JSON output from
  Sui CLI.

## Contract Overview

The example contract demonstrates how to handle cross-chain interactions between
ZetaChain and Sui. The contract implements a `connected` module that:

- Receives tokens from ZetaChain through the `on_call` function
- Performs a token swap using a mock Cetus DEX implementation
- Transfers the swapped tokens to a specified receiver address

The Sui contract uses `0x2::coin` and a custom `token::TOKEN` type to represent
the transferred asset.

## Clone the Example Project

Begin by cloning the example contracts repository and installing its
dependencies:

```bash
npx zetachain@next new --project call
cd call
yarn
```

## Launch Localnet

Start your local development environment, which sets up instances of ZetaChain
and Sui:

```bash
npx zetachain localnet start
```

Keep this terminal window open. You should see a table displaying the deployment
details, including Gateway module and object IDs.

## Deploy a Contract on Sui

Navigate to the Sui contract directory and deploy the contract:

```bash
cd sui
```

```
sui move build --force
```

Get some Sui tokens from the faucet:

```
sui client faucet
```

```
PUBLISHED=$(sui client publish --skip-dependency-verification --json)
```

```
PACKAGE=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "published") | .packageId') && echo $PACKAGE
```

This will deploy the contract and store the package ID in the `$PACKAGE`
variable.

## Set Up the Pool

After deployment, you'll need to set up the pool by minting tokens and creating
the initial liquidity.

Get the treasury cap:

```bash
TREASURY=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "0x2::coin::TreasuryCap<\($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId') && echo $TREASURY
```

Get the pool ID:

```
POOL=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Pool<0x2::sui::SUI, \($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId') && echo $POOL
```

Mint tokens to your address:

```
RECIPIENT=$(sui client active-address) && echo $RECIPIENT
```

```
sui client call \
  --package "$PACKAGE" \
  --module token \
  --function mint_and_transfer \
  --args "$TREASURY" 1000000 "$RECIPIENT"
```

Get the token ID:

```
TOKEN=$(sui client objects --json | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.[].data | select(.type == "0x2::coin::Coin<\($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId') && echo $TOKEN
```

Deposit tokens into the pool:

```
sui client call \
  --package "$PACKAGE" \
  --module cetusmock \
  --function deposit \
  --type-args "0x2::sui::SUI" "$PACKAGE::token::TOKEN" \
  --args "$POOL" "$TOKEN"
```

## Deposit SUI to Gateway

To enable cross-chain operations, you need to deposit SUI tokens to the
ZetaChain gateway. First, get your SUI coin ID:

```
COIN=$(sui client gas --json | jq -r '.[0].gasCoinId') && echo $COIN
```

```
ETH_ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
GATEWAY_PACKAGE=0xa3ce10f68ed22d2cbbc31eaa709ee15e2e30348bfc6ff97b7d128d03b679c5c2
GATEWAY_OBJECT=0xe925d4059435083b70bc504ce912202214edd06f693bdc3f9573a996292780c7
```

Then, deposit SUI to the gateway using the gateway addresses from your localnet
output:

```
sui client call \
  --package "$GATEWAY_PACKAGE" \
  --module gateway \
  --function deposit \
  --type-args 0x2::sui::SUI \
  --args "$GATEWAY_OBJECT" "$COIN" "$ETH_ADDRESS"
```

> **Note**: Make sure to replace the `GATEWAY_PACKAGE` and `GATEWAY_OBJECT`
> values with the ones from your localnet output. These addresses are displayed
> in the table when you start the localnet.

## Prepare Withdraw and Call

Now you can execute the withdraw and call operation. This will withdraw tokens
from ZetaChain to Sui and simultaneously call a contract on Sui.

Get the required contract IDs:

```bash
CONFIG=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::GlobalConfig") | .objectId') && echo $CONFIG
```

```
CLOCK=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Clock") | .objectId') && echo $CLOCK
```

```
PARTNER=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Partner") | .objectId') && echo $PARTNER
```

Prepare the payload:

```
MESSAGE=$RECIPIENT
```

```
TOKEN_TYPE="$PACKAGE::token::TOKEN" && echo $TOKEN_TYPE
```

```
PAYLOAD=$(npx ts-node ./setup/encodeCallArgs.ts "$TOKEN_TYPE" "$CONFIG,$POOL,$PARTNER,$CLOCK" "$MESSAGE") && echo $PAYLOAD
```

## Execute the withdraw and call

Approve Gateway to spend ZRC-20 Sui:

```
cast send 0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891 "approve(address,uint256)" 0x2279B7A0a67DB372996a5FaB50D91eAA73d2eBe6 1000000000000000000000000 --private-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Withdraw and call:

```
cast send 0x2279B7A0a67DB372996a5FaB50D91eAA73d2eBe6 "withdrawAndCall(bytes,uint256,address,bytes,(uint256,bool),(address,bool,address,bytes,uint256))" \
  "$PACKAGE" \
  "1000000" \
  "0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891" \
  "$PAYLOAD" \
  "(10000,false)" \
  "(0xB0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48,true,0xC0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB49,0xdeadbeef,50000)" \
  --private-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

This transaction will:

1. Withdraw tokens from ZetaChain to Sui
2. Call a Sui contract with the specified parameters

The operation demonstrates how to perform complex cross-chain operations that
combine asset withdrawals with contract calls, enabling sophisticated DeFi
interactions between ZetaChain and Sui.
