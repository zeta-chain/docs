This tutorial shows how to send cross-chain messages between contracts on two
EVM chains using ZetaChain‚Äôs messaging infrastructure.

Unlike universal apps deployed directly on ZetaChain, this approach allows you
to keep all contract logic on connected EVM chains. Messages are automatically
routed between them through ZetaChain, without requiring any contracts to be
deployed on ZetaChain itself.

> Why use this pattern? Unlike universal apps deployed directly on ZetaChain,
> here all business logic stays on the connected EVM chains you already know.
> ZetaChain merely transports the payload, no contract code is deployed on
> ZetaChain itself.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Deploy a messaging contract to two EVM testnets (Base and Ethereum Sepolia)
- Link them for cross-chain communication
- Send a message and token value from one to the other
- Track the cross-chain transaction from source to destination

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v18+
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/) for parsing JSON in shell scripts
- A funded private key for both Base Sepolia (84532) and Ethereum Sepolia
  (11155111)

## Create a Project

Create a new project using the `messaging` template:

```
npx zetachain new --project messaging
```

Install TypeSCcipt and Foundry dependencies:

```
cd messaging
yarn
forge soldeer update
```

Compile contracts:

```
forge build
```

Save your private key in an environment variable so shell scripts can read it:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

## Messaging Contract

To enable cross-chain messaging, your contract must inherit from ZetaChain‚Äôs
`Messaging` base contract and implement a few required functions.

Import the `Messaging.sol` contract from the ZetaChain standard contracts
package:

```solidity
import "@zetachain/standard-contracts/contracts/messaging/contracts/Messaging.sol";
```

Inherit from `Messaging` in your contract:

```solidity
contract Example is Messaging { ... }
```

Initialize the contract with the required parameters in the constructor:

```solidity
constructor(
    address payable _gateway,
    address owner,
    address _router
) Messaging(_gateway, owner, _router) {}
```

The Messa`ging base contract provides built-in access to Gateway and Router, and
ensures your contract is correctly wired into ZetaChain‚Äôs cross-chain messaging
system.

You must implement three core internal functions for handling message delivery
and fallback:

#### onMessageReceive

This is called automatically on the destination chain when a cross-chain message
arrives successfully.

```solidity
function onMessageReceive(
    bytes memory data,
    bytes memory sender,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory asset
) internal override {
    //...
}
```

Use this function to decode the message and execute logic like updating state,
triggering downstream calls, or transferring the received token value.

### onMessageRevert

This is triggered if the destination contract‚Äôs onMessageReceive fails (e.g.,
due to invalid calldata or logic errors).

```solidity
function onMessageRevert(
    bytes memory data,
    bytes memory sender,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes memory asset
) internal override {
    //...
}
```

### onRevert

This is called when a message fails during routing before reaching the
destination chain. It executes on the source chain.

```solidity
function onRevert(RevertContext calldata context)
    external
    payable
    override
    onlyGateway
{
    if (context.sender != router) revert Unauthorized();
    //...
}
```

You can use this to refund the user, trigger compensation logic, or emit a
notification.

### Sending a Message

To initiate a cross-chain message, your contract must call the `depositAndCall`
function on the EVM Gateway. This function is what hands off your message and
optional token value to ZetaChain‚Äôs messaging layer for routing.

Depending on whether you're sending native gas (like ETH) or ERC-20 tokens,
you‚Äôll use one of the following two forms of `depositAndCall`.

If you want to send a message with ETH as the value:

```solidity
gateway.depositAndCall{value: msg.value}(
    router,
    message,
    revertOptions
);
```

If you're sending supported ERC-20 tokens:

```solidity
gateway.depositAndCall(
    router,
    amount,
    asset,
    message,
    revertOptions
);
```

`asset` is the ERC-20 token address being sent (must be supported by ZetaChain).

### What‚Äôs Inside the Message Payload?

The `message` argument is a single `bytes` field. It is ABI-encoded and must
follow a structure that the Universal Router on ZetaChain understands.

```solidity
abi.encode(
    receiver,       // bytes: destination contract address on the target chain
    targetToken,    // address: ZRC-20 address of the token to transfer to the destination contract
    data,           // bytes: message payload (e.g., ABI-encoded "hello")
    gasLimit,       // uint256: gas to forward for execution on the target chain
    revertOptions   // struct: defines what to do on failure
)
```

If you're sending the string `"hello"` to a contract on Ethereum Sepolia, you
might encode:

```solidity
bytes memory data = abi.encode("hello");
bytes memory message = abi.encode(
    abi.encodePacked(receiver),  // Destination contract address (as bytes)
    targetToken,                 // Token to transfer on destination chain
    data,                        // ABI-encoded message
    300_000,                     // Gas limit
    revertOptions                // Struct specifying fallback behavior
);
```

This message is then passed to `depositAndCall()` and routed through ZetaChain
to the destination chain, where it is decoded and passed into the destination
contract‚Äôs `onMessageReceive()`.

### What Is the Universal Router?

When you send a cross-chain message via `gateway.depositAndCall(...)`, the
actual logic that handles routing and execution on ZetaChain is implemented
inside a contract called the **Universal Router**.

This contract runs on ZetaChain and acts as the **entry point for all
cross-chain messaging logic**. It is responsible for:

- **Parsing the message payload** sent from the source chain
- **Swapping tokens** (if necessary) into:

  - The destination chain's **gas token** to cover execution fees
  - The destination contract's **target token** to be delivered

- **Forwarding the message** and token to the destination contract
- **Handling fallback logic** in case the destination call fails

All contracts that use the Messaging base contract share the same Universal
Router. This shared router simplifies development, ensuring consistent behavior
across all messaging-based apps.

The Universal Router ensures that your contract only needs to focus on sending
an encoded payload, everything else, from gas handling to token transfer to
delivery mechanics, is managed for you.

You don‚Äôt need to interact with the Universal Router directly. Just encode your
message, call the Gateway, and ZetaChain will handle the rest.

> üîß Advanced: If you need more control, for example, to customize how tokens
> are swapped, route to different contracts, or handle messages differently, you
> can deploy your own instance of a router and point your contracts to it by
> passing its address to the Messaging constructor.

## Deploy Messaging Contracts

Deploy to Base Sepolia:

```
MESSAGING_BASE=$(./commands/index.ts deploy --rpc https://sepolia.base.org --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY | jq -r .contractAddress)
```

Deploy to Ethereum Sepolia:

```
MESSAGING_ETHEREUM=$(./commands/index.ts deploy --rpc https://sepolia.drpc.org --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY | jq -r .contractAddress)
```

## Connect Two Contracts

Before two contracts can communicate across chains, they need to explicitly
trust each other. This prevents malicious contracts from spoofing cross-chain
messages. In this step, you‚Äôll establish a bidirectional link between the two
deployed messaging contracts.

Each contract needs to know:

- The address of the counterpart contract on the remote chain
- The chain ID of that remote chain

This is done using the `setConnected()` function in the messaging contract.
ZetaChain‚Äôs cross-chain infrastructure will only deliver messages to a contract
if it has registered the sender as trusted.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you skip this step or set the wrong address/chain ID, messages will be
rejected on the destination chain.

```
./commands/index.ts connect \
  --contract $MESSAGING_BASE \
  --target-contract $MESSAGING_ETHEREUM \
  --rpc https://sepolia.base.org \
  --target-chain-id 11155111 \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

```
./commands/index.ts connect \
  --contract $MESSAGING_ETHEREUM \
  --target-contract $MESSAGING_BASE \
  --rpc https://sepolia.drpc.org \
  --target-chain-id 84532 \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Once both directions are linked, the contracts can send and receive messages.

## Send a Cross-Chain Message

Now that your contracts are deployed and connected, you can send a message from
one to the other.

This example sends the string "hello" from the contract on Base Sepolia to the
contract on Ethereum Sepolia,

```
./commands/index.ts message \
  --rpc https://sepolia.base.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --contract $MESSAGING_BASE \
  --target-contract $MESSAGING_ETHEREUM \
  --types string \
  --values hello \
  --target-token 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --amount 0.005
```

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--rpc https://sepolia.base.org`        | The RPC endpoint for the **source chain** (Base Sepolia). This is where the transaction will be sent.                                                   |
| `--private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`            | The account that signs and funds the transaction on the source chain. It must hold the token being sent.                                                |
| `--contract $MESSAGING_BASE`            | Address of the messaging contract deployed on the source chain. This contract initiates the cross-chain call.                                           |
| `--target-contract $MESSAGING_ETHEREUM` | The address of the contract on the **destination chain**. This is the final recipient of the message.                                                   |
| `--types string`                        | The ABI type of the message you‚Äôre sending. This can be a single type (like `string`) or a tuple (e.g., `string,uint256`).                              |
| `--values hello`                        | The actual value to encode and send across chains, in this case, just the string `"hello"`.                                                             |
| `--target-token 0x...`                  | The ZRC20 token address on ZetaChain that represents the destination chain‚Äôs token. This tells ZetaChain what asset to transfer to the target contract. |
| `--amount 0.005`                        | The total amount of tokens sent. A portion of this covers gas fees on the destination chain; the remainder is transferred to the destination contract.  |

### How Amount is Handled

When you send a cross-chain message using `--amount`, you're not just
transferring tokens, you‚Äôre also prepaying for gas on the destination chain.
Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. You **supply tokens** on the source chain (e.g., Base ETH). This can be
   native gas (like ETH) or any supported ERC-20.
2. You specify a **target token** via `--target-token`, which points to the
   ZRC-20 representing the token you want to deliver on the destination chain
   (e.g., Ethereum ETH).
3. On ZetaChain:

   - A **portion of the supplied amount** is automatically swapped into the
     ZRC-20 version of the **gas token** for the destination chain (Ethereum ETH
     in this example). This is used to cover the **execution cost** of the
     message on the destination chain.
   - The **remaining amount** is swapped into the **target token** (which might
     be the same token) and forwarded to the destination contract.

This makes the system fully automated: you don‚Äôt need to hold or acquire the
destination chain‚Äôs native token to interact with it.

## Track the Cross-Chain Transaction

Use the transaction hash from the previous step to query its cross-chain status:

```
zetachain q cctx --hash 0x939e230dd504efdf1fce31202a5980b4d0376430ddf535d080666256353c02c3
