On ZetaChain, you can build universal apps: smart contracts that can read,
write, and manage assets across multiple chains. Universal apps remove the
complexity of cross-chain development and let you create seamless user
experiences that work everywhere.

This page will help you set up your environment, install the core tools, and
point you to the right tutorials depending on what you want to build.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system is set up with the following tools:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v21 or later recommended):** Required to
  run the ZetaChain CLI and manage JavaScript dependencies.
- **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or npm:** Package managers used to install and
  update project libraries. Either works, use whichever you prefer.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/):** Essential for managing your project source
  code and collaborating with others.
- **[jq](https://jqlang.org/):** A lightweight command-line JSON processor,
  useful for parsing Localnet output and writing shell scripts.
- **[Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/):** A fast, modular toolkit for Ethereum
  development. You’ll use it to compile contracts, manage dependencies, and run
  Localnet.

## Setting up Environment

Install the ZetaChain CLI:

```bash
npm install -g zetachain
```

The [ZetaChain CLI](/reference/cli/) is your primary tool for working with
ZetaChain. You’ll use it to make cross-chain calls, transfer tokens, track
cross-chain transactions, manage accounts across multiple networks, query
balances, and more.

Try running:

```bash
zetachain query chains list
```

This command prints all the chains currently connected to ZetaChain, a good way
to confirm your setup is working.

For local development, we recommend running Localnet, a self-contained
environment that includes ZetaChain, EVM, Solana, Sui, and TON. Localnet is the
fastest way to build and test universal apps without relying on public testnets.

To run Localnet, make sure you have [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) installed.
Foundry provides the core tooling for EVM development and is required to start
the local network.

If you want to include non-EVM chains in Localnet, check the prerequisites in
the [Localnet documentation](/reference/localnet/).

## Tools & References

With your environment ready, these resources will help you interact with and
build on ZetaChain.

### Explorers

ZetaChain is both a Cosmos chain and an EVM chain. You can use Cosmos explorers
to view blocks, validators, and governance activity, or EVM explorers to track
contracts and transactions. Links to both are available in the [Explorers
reference](/reference/explorers/).

### Faucets

Before deploying or testing on testnet, you’ll need tokens. The
[Faucet](/reference/faucet/) page lists all available faucets: for ZETA gas and
for tokens on connected chains.

### Networks

ZetaChain runs on mainnet and testnet. Tutorials focus on testnet, but you can
switch at any time. RPC endpoints, chain IDs, and other details are listed in
the [Networks reference](/developers/chains/list/).

### RPCs

To connect apps, wallets, or frameworks like Foundry and Hardhat, you’ll need
RPC endpoints. Public RPCs for both ZetaChain mainnet and testnet are listed in
the [RPC reference](/reference/networks/api).

### Contracts

Core protocol contracts such as the Gateway, and other system contracts are
deployed on ZetaChain. Their addresses are listed in the [Protocol Contracts
reference](/reference/network/contracts/).

### Tokens

All whitelisted tokens available on ZetaChain are listed along with their ZRC-20
contract addresses in the [Tokens reference](/reference/tokens/).

## Where to Go Next

Once your environment is set up, you can dive straight into building. Choose a
path based on what you want to create:

### Learn the basics

- [First Universal Contract](/developers/tutorials/hello/) (10 min) Build your
  first universal contract and understand the foundation of ZetaChain
  development.
- [Build a Web App](/developers/tutorials/frontend) (10 min) Connect a wallet,
  send cross-chain calls, and track execution with a simple frontend.

### Make calls to and from universal apps

- [EVM](/developers/tutorials/call/) (30 min) Learn how to send and receive
  calls between EVM chains and universal apps on ZetaChain.
- [Solana](/developers/tutorials/solana/) (60 min) Deposit assets and call
  universal apps from Solana, or make outgoing calls to Solana.
- [Sui](/developers/tutorials/sui/) (60 min) Deposit assets and call universal
  apps from Sui.
- [Sui Withdraw & Call](/developers/tutorials/sui-withdraw-and-call/) (60 min)
  Withdraw assets and call contracts on Sui.

### Cross-Chain Messaging

- [Messaging](/developers/tutorials/messaging/) (30 min) Make cross-chain calls
  directly between EVM networks without building a universal app.

### Build real-world apps

- [Universal NFT](/developers/standards/nft/) (45 min) Create NFTs that can move
  seamlessly across multiple chains.
- [Universal Token](/developers/standards/token/) (45 min) Deploy a fungible
  token that exists everywhere and can be transferred across chains.
- [Swap](/developers/tutorials/swap/) (30 min) Implement a universal swap app
  compatible with chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin.
