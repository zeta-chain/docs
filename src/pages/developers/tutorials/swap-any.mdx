title: Swap to Any Token
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

In the previous [Swap](/developers/tutorials/swap) tutorial, you created a
universal swap contract that allows users to exchange tokens from one connected
blockchain for a token on another blockchain. In that implementation, the
swapped token was always withdrawn to the destination chain. This tutorial
expands on that by enhancing the contract to support swapping tokens to any
token (such as ZRC-20, ERC-20, or ZETA) and offering users the flexibility to
either withdraw the token to the destination chain or retain it on ZetaChain.

The ability to keep swapped tokens on ZetaChain can be particularly useful if
you intend to utilize ZRC-20 tokens in non-universal contracts that aren't yet
equipped to accept tokens from connected chains. It is also useful if the
destination token is ZETA, which you may want to keep on ZetaChain for further
use.

In this enhanced version, you will modify the original swap contract to support
this additional functionality. You will also deploy the modified contract to
localnet and interact with it by swapping tokens from a connected EVM chain.

<Alert>This tutorial relies on the Gateway, which is currently available only on localnet and testnet.</Alert>

## Setting Up Your Environment

To get started, clone the example contracts repository and install the
dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts

cd example-contracts/examples/swap

yarn
```

## Understanding the SwapToAnyToken Contract

The `SwapToAnyToken` contract builds on the previous swap contract by allowing
users to swap tokens to any target token and giving them the option to either
withdraw the swapped tokens to the destination chain or keep them on ZetaChain.
This added flexibility makes the contract more versatile for a variety of use
cases.

The contract introduces a key enhancement: a `withdraw` flag. This flag
determines whether the swapped tokens should be withdrawn to a connected chain
or remain on ZetaChain. Additionally, the contract supports both cross-chain
calls and direct interactions on ZetaChain, making it useful for scenarios where
tokens are already on ZetaChain and you don’t need to involve a connected chain.

### Differences Between Swap and SwapToAnyToken Contracts

In this new version, the core structure remains similar, but several key changes
have been made to extend its functionality.

First, the `Params` struct has been updated to include a `withdraw` flag. This
allows users to specify whether they want the swapped tokens withdrawn to a
connected chain or kept on ZetaChain. The `onCall` function now decodes this
additional flag from the incoming message. For EVM chains and Solana, the
contract decodes the `withdraw` flag alongside other parameters. For Bitcoin,
due to the smaller message size allowed by its OP_RETURN, the contract checks if
the message length is sufficient before extracting the `withdraw` flag.

The `swapAndWithdraw` function has also been modified to conditionally handle
gas fees based on whether the tokens will be withdrawn. If the `withdraw` flag
is set to `true`, the contract proceeds with the usual gas fee calculation and
deduction. If the flag is `false`, it skips the gas fee handling and simply
swaps the full amount of tokens.

Once the tokens are swapped, the contract either withdraws them to the
destination chain or transfers them directly on ZetaChain. When `withdraw` is
`true`, it follows the same withdrawal process as the original contract, using
the gateway to send tokens to the connected chain. However, if `withdraw` is
`false`, it transfers the tokens directly to the recipient on ZetaChain without
involving the gateway.

Additionally, a new public `swap` function has been introduced, which allows
users to interact with the contract directly on ZetaChain. This function is
particularly useful if you already have tokens on ZetaChain and want to swap
them without making a cross-chain call. It takes in parameters similar to those
in `onCall`, transfers the input tokens from the sender to the contract, and
then calls `swapAndWithdraw` to perform the swap and handle withdrawal or direct
transfer based on the `withdraw` flag.

Finally, the contract now imports the `IWETH9` interface to handle direct token
transfers when `withdraw` is `false`. This interface facilitates the transfer of
wrapped tokens on ZetaChain.

## Starting Localnet

To simulate ZetaChain’s behavior locally, start the local development
environment by running:

```
npx hardhat localnet
```

## Deploying the Contract

Once your environment is set up, compile the contract and deploy it to localnet
using the following command:

```
npx hardhat deploy \
  --name SwapToAnyToken \
  --network localhost \
  --gateway 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 \
  --uniswap-router 0x9fE46736679d2D9a65F0992F2272dE9f3c7fa6e0
```

After deployment, you should see an output similar to this:

```
🔑 Using account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

🚀 Successfully deployed contract on localhost.
📜 Contract address: 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181
```

## Swap and Withdraw Tokens to Connected Chain

To swap tokens from a connected EVM chain and withdraw them to the destination
chain, use the following command:

```
npx hardhat swap-from-evm \
  --network localhost \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --withdraw true
```

- EVM gateway is called with 1 native gas token (ETH) and a message that
  contains target ZRC-20 token address, receiver address and a boolean that
  indicates to withdraw a token to the destination chain or not.
- `onCall` is called
- If `withdraw` is:
  - true, withdraw the ZRC-20 to the destination chain as a native token
  - false, send target ZRC-20 to the recipient

In the command above the `withdraw` is `true`, so the target ZRC-20 token will
be transferred to the destination chain.

## Swap Tokens Without Withdrawing

If you want to swap tokens and keep them on ZetaChain rather than withdrawing
them, set the `withdraw` flag.

```
npx hardhat swap-from-evm \
  --network localhost \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --withdraw false
```

In the command above the `withdraw` is `false`, so the target ZRC-20 token will
be transferred to the recipient on ZetaChain.

## Swap on ZetaChain and Withdraw Tokens to Connected Chain

To swap a ZRC-20 token for another ZRC-20 on ZetaChain and withdraw to a
connected chain, run:

```
npx hardhat swap-from-zetachain \
  --network localhost \
  --contract 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x65a45c57636f9BcCeD4fe193A602008578BcA90b \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --zrc20 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --withdraw true
```

## Swap on ZetaChain Without Withdrawing

To swap a ZRC-20 token for another ZRC-20 on ZetaChain and transfer it to a
recipient on ZetaChain, run:

```
npx hardhat swap-from-zetachain \
  --network localhost \
  --contract 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --amount 1 \
  --target 0x65a45c57636f9BcCeD4fe193A602008578BcA90b \
  --recipient 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --zrc20 0x05BA149A7bd6dC1F937fA9046A9e05C05f3b18b0 \
  --withdraw false
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you extended the functionality of the original swap contract
by adding the ability to swap tokens to any token and decide whether to withdraw
them to a connected chain or keep them on ZetaChain. You also learned how to
deploy the contract and interact with it both via cross-chain calls and directly
on ZetaChain, providing greater flexibility for a variety of use cases.
