title: Call, Deposit & Withdraw
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

In this tutorial, you'll create two contracts: a Universal contract on ZetaChain
and a Connected contract, deployed on one of the connected EVM chains. The
Connected contract implements functions that use the Gateway contract to make
calls and token deposits to the Universal contract. The Universal app implements
functions to make calls and tokens withdrawals to a connected chain.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to:

- Create contracts that use the Gateway to make cross-chain calls
- Make cross-chain calls, token deposits and withdrawals (both native gas and
  supported ERC-20s)
- Gracefully handle reverts

<Alert>This tutorial relies on the Gateway, which is currently available only on localnet and testnet.</Alert>

## Prerequisites

```

Let's break down what this contract does. The `Universal` contract inherits from
the
[`UniversalContract`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/v2/contracts/zevm/interfaces/UniversalContract.sol)
interface, which requires the implementation of `onCall` and `onRevert`
functions for handling cross-chain interactions.

A state variable `gateway` of type `GatewayZEVM` holds the address of
ZetaChain's gateway contract. This gateway facilitates communication between
ZetaChain and connected chains.

In the constructor, we initialize the `gateway` state variable with the address
of the ZetaChain gateway contract.

### Handling Incoming Cross-Chain Calls

Within `onCall`, the contract decodes the `name` from the `message` and emits a
`HelloEvent` to signal successful reception and processing of the message. It's
important to note that `onCall` can only be invoked by the ZetaChain protocol,
ensuring the integrity of cross-chain interactions.

### Making an Outgoing Contract Call

The `call` function demonstrates how a universal app can initiate a contract
call to an arbitrary contract on a connected chain using the gateway. It
operates as follows:

1. **Calculate Gas Fee**: Determines the required gas fee based on the specified
   `gasLimit`. The gas limit represents the anticipated amount of gas needed to
   execute the contract on the destination chain.

2. **Transfer Gas Fee**: Moves the calculated gas fee from the sender to the
   `Universal` contract. The user must grant the `Universal` contract permission
   to spend their gas fee tokens.

3. **Approve Gateway**: Grants the gateway permission to spend the transferred
   gas fee.

4. **Execute Cross-Chain Call**: Invokes `gateway.call` to initiate the contract
   call on the connected chain. The message (for authenticated calls) or the
   function selector and its arguments (for arbitrary calls) are encoded within
   the `message`. Learn more about arbitrary and authenticated calls in the
   [Call Options doc](/developers/chains/zetachain/#call-options). The gateway
   identifies the target chain based on the ZRC-20 token, as each chain's gas
   asset is associated with a specific ZRC-20 token.

### Withdrawing Tokens

The `withdraw` function withdraws ZRC-20 tokens from ZetaChain to a connected
chain. The function executes the following steps:

1. **Calculate Gas Fee**: Computes the necessary gas fee based on the provided
   `gasLimit`.

2. **Transfer Tokens**: Moves the specified `amount` of tokens from the sender
   to the `Universal` contract. If the token being withdrawn is the gas token of
   the destination chain, the function transfers and approves both the gas fee
   and the withdrawal amount. If the target token is not the gas token, it
   transfers and approves the gas fee separately.

3. **Approve Gateway**: Grants the gateway permission to spend the transferred
   tokens and gas fee.

4. **Execute Withdrawal**: Calls `gateway.withdraw` to withdraw the tokens.

If a user withdraws an ERC-20 token, the contract assumes that the user has a
required amount of gas ZRC-20 tokens to pay the withdraw fee. In a
production-ready contract the contract might need to swap a fraction of the
token being withdrawn to cover the withdraw fee.

### Withdrawing Tokens and Making a Call

The `withdrawAndCall` function shows how a universal app can perform a token
withdrawal with a call to an arbitrary contract on a connected chain using the
gateway. The function executes the following steps:

1. **Calculate gas fee, transfer tokens, approve gateway**: execute the same
   steps as `withdraw`.
2. **Execute Withdrawal and Call**: Calls `gateway.withdrawAndCall` to withdraw
   the tokens and initiate the contract call on the connected chain. Compared to
   simple withdrawing, `withdrawAndCall` also accepts a message (similar to
   `call` it can be a regular message for authenticated calls or a function
   selector and parameters for arbitrary calls) and call options.

    ) external onlyGateway {
        emit RevertEvent("Revert on EVM", revertContext);
    }

    receive() external payable {}

    fallback() external payable {}
}
```

### Making a Contract Call

The `call` functions executes `gateway.call` to make a cross-chain call to the
`onCall` function of a universal contract on ZetaChain. The `receiver` parameter
determines which universal contract will be called, and the `message` contains
the bytes that will be passed to the `onCall` function.

### Depositing Tokens

The `deposit` function uses the Gateway to deposit native gas or supported
ERC-20 tokens to a contract or an EOA on ZetaChain. `deposit` only makes a
cross-chain transfer without executing logic on ZetaChain, even if the
`receiver` is a universal contract.

Tokens deposited through the Gateway end up as ZRC-20 assets on ZetaChain.

### Depositing Tokens and Making a Call

The `depositAndCall` function uses the Gateway to deposit native gas or
supported ERC-20 tokens and make a cross-chain call to the `onCall` function of
a universal contract on ZetaChain.

## Option 1: Deploy on Localnet

[Localnet](/developers/tutorials/localnet) provides a simulated environment for
developing and testing ZetaChain contracts locally.

To start localnet, open a terminal window and run:

```bash
npx hardhat localnet
```

This command initializes a local blockchain environment that simulates the
behavior of ZetaChain protocol contracts.

## Deploying the Contracts

With localnet running, open a new terminal window to compile and deploy the
`Universal` and `Connected` contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile --force
npx hardhat deploy --name Universal --network localhost --gateway 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707
npx hardhat deploy --name Connected --network localhost --gateway 0x610178dA211FEF7D417bC0e6FeD39F05609AD788
```

You should see output indicating the successful deployment of the contracts:

```
🔑 Using account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

🚀 Successfully deployed "Universal" contract on localhost.
📜 Contract address: 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181

🔑 Using account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

🚀 Successfully deployed "Connected" contract on localhost.
📜 Contract address: 0xFD471836031dc5108809D173A067e8486B9047A3
```

**Note**: The deployed contract addresses may differ in your environment.

## Calling the `Connected` Contract from `Universal`

In this example, you'll invoke the `Connected` contract on the connected EVM
chain, which in turn calls the `Universal` contract on ZetaChain. Run the
following command, replacing the contract addresses with those from your
deployment:

```bash
npx hardhat connected-call \
  --contract 0xFD471836031dc5108809D173A067e8486B9047A3 \
  --receiver 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --network localhost \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

## Calling an EVM Contract from a Universal App

Now, let's perform the reverse operation: calling a contract on a connected EVM
chain from the `Universal` universal app on ZetaChain. Execute the following
command, replacing the contract addresses and ZRC-20 token address with those
from your deployment:

```bash
npx hardhat universal-call \
  --contract 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --receiver 0xFD471836031dc5108809D173A067e8486B9047A3 \
  --zrc20 0x2ca7d64A7EFE2D62A725E2B35Cf7230D6677FfEe \
  --function "hello(string)" \
  --network localhost \
  --types '["string"]' alice
```

## Withdrawing and Calling an EVM Contract from a Universal App

To withdraw tokens and call a contract on a connected chain from a universal
app, run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat universal-withdraw-and-call \
  --contract 0xc351628EB244ec633d5f21fBD6621e1a683B1181 \
  --receiver 0xFD471836031dc5108809D173A067e8486B9047A3 \
  --zrc20 0x2ca7d64A7EFE2D62A725E2B35Cf7230D6677FfEe \
  --function "hello(string)" \
  --amount 1 \
  --call-options-is-arbitrary-call \
  --network localhost \
  --types '["string"]' hello
```

## Option 2: Deploy on Testnet

Before proceeding, you might want to check out the [Testnet
Setup](/developers/tutorials/testnet) guide to learn how to set up an account
and request testnet tokens.

```bash
npx hardhat compile --force
npx hardhat deploy --gateway 0x6c533f7fe93fae114d0954697069df33c9b74fd7 --network zeta_testnet --name Universal
npx hardhat deploy --gateway 0x0c487a766110c85d301d96e33579c5b317fa4995 --network base_sepolia --name Connected
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've:

- Defined a universal app contract (`Universal`) to handle cross-chain messages.
- Deployed both `Universal` and `Connected` contracts to a local development
  network.
- Interacted with the `Universal` contract by sending messages from a connected
  EVM chain via the `Connected` contract.
- Simulated revert scenarios and handled them gracefully using revert logic in
  both contracts.

By mastering cross-chain calls and revert handling, you're now prepared to build
robust and resilient universal applications on ZetaChain.
