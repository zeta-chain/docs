To interact with universal applications from TON, use the TON gateway.

TON gateway supports:

- Depositing TON to a universal app or an account on ZetaChain
- Depositing TON and calling a universal app
- Withdrawing TON from ZetaChain

## Deposit TON

To deposit TON to an EOA or a universal contract, send an internal message to
the Gateway contract with the following structure:

```func
op_code:uint32 query_id:uint64 evm_recipient:slice (160 bits)
```

The deposit `op_code` is `101`. `query_id` is reserved for future use, leave it
to `0`.

The `evm_recipient` specifies the address on ZetaChain that will receive the
deposited TON. This can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a
universal app address.

Here's an example of how to construct the deposit message in TypeScript:

```typescript
const opDeposit = 101;
const body = beginCell().storeUint(opDeposit, 32).storeUint(0, 64).storeUint(zevmRecipient, 160).endCell();
```

After the deposit is processed, the receiver receives the [ZRC-20
version](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the deposited TON.

## Deposit TON and Call a Universal App

To deposit TON and call a universal app contract, send an internal message to
the Gateway contract with the following structure:

```func
op_code:uint32 query_id:uint64 evm_recipient:slice (160 bits) call_data:cell
```

The depositAndCall `op_code` is `102`. `query_id` is reserved for future use,
leave it to `0`. Also note that call_data should be a cell encoded in ["snake
data"](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/nft-processing/metadata-parsing#snake-data-encoding)
format (supported by most TON libraries)

The `evm_recipient` must be the address of a universal app contract.

The `call_data` cell contains the payload that will be passed to the `onCall`
function of the universal app contract.

Here's an example of how to construct the deposit-and-call message in
TypeScript:

```typescript
const opDepositAndCall = 102;
const body = beginCell()
  .storeUint(opDepositAndCall, 32)
  .storeUint(0, 64)
  .storeUint(zevmRecipient, 160)
  .storeRef(callDataCell) // callDataCell should be a cell containing the payload
  .endCell();
```

After the cross-chain transaction is processed, the `onCall` function of the
universal app contract is executed.
