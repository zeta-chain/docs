To interact with universal applications from TON, use the TON gateway.

TON gateway supports:

- Depositing TON to a universal app or an account on ZetaChain
- Depositing TON and calling a universal app
- Withdrawing TON from ZetaChain

## Deposit TON

To deposit TON to an EOA or a universal contract, send an internal message to
the Gateway contract with the following structure:

```func
op_code:uint32 query_id:uint64 evm_recipient:slice (160 bits)
;; Message body structure
;; op_code: 32 bits
;; query_id: 64 bits
;; evm_recipient: 160 bits (20 bytes)
```

The deposit `op_code` is `101`. `query_id` is reserved for future use, leave it to `0`.

The `evm_recipient` specifies the address on ZetaChain that will receive the
deposited TON. This can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a
universal app address.

After the deposit is processed, the receiver receives the [ZRC-20
version](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the deposited TON.

## Deposit TON and Call a Universal App

To deposit TON and call a universal app contract, send an internal message to
the Gateway contract with the following structure:

```fc
op_code:uint32 query_id:uint64 evm_recipient:slice (160 bits) call_data:cell
;; op_code: 32 bits
;; query_id: 64 bits
;; evm_recipient: 160 bits (20 bytes)
;; call_data: cell (up to 2KB)
```

The `op_code` should be set to `102` for deposit and call operations.

The `evm_recipient` must be the address of a universal app contract.

The `call_data` cell contains the payload that will be passed to the `onCall`
function of the universal app contract.

After the cross-chain transaction is processed, the `onCall` function of the
universal app contract is executed.

## Gas Fees

The Gateway contract charges gas fees for different operations:

- Deposit: 10,000 gas units
- Deposit and Call: 13,000 gas units
- Authority operations: 20,000 gas units
- Withdraw: 17,500 gas units

These fees are deducted from the deposited or withdrawn amount to cover the cost
of processing the transaction on ZetaChain.
