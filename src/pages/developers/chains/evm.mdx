To interact with universal applications from EVM-compatible chains like
Ethereum, BNB, Polygon, and others, use the EVM gateway.

EVM gateway supports:

- Depositing gas tokens to a universal app or an account on ZetaChain.
- Depositing supported ERC-20 tokens (including ZETA tokens).
- Depositing gas tokens and calling a universal app.
- Depositing supported ERC-20 tokens and calling a universal app.
- Calling a universal app.

## Deposit Gas Tokens

To deposit tokens to an EOA or a universal contract, call the `deposit` function
of the Gateway contract:

```solidity
deposit(address receiver, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external payable;
```

The `deposit` function is payable, meaning it accepts native gas tokens (e.g.,
ETH on Ethereum), which will then be sent to a `receiver` on ZetaChain.

The `receiver` can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a universal
app address on ZetaChain. Even if the receiver is a universal app contract with
the standard `receive` function, the `deposit` function will not trigger a
contract call. If you want to deposit and call a universal app, use the
`depositAndCall` function instead.

After the deposit is processed, the receiver receives the [ZRC-20
version](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the deposited tokenâ€”for example, ZRC-20
ETH.

## Deposit ERC-20 Tokens

The `deposit` function can also be used to send supported ERC-20 tokens to EOAs
and universal apps on ZetaChain:

```solidity
deposit(address receiver, uint256 amount, address asset, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

Only [supported ERC-20 assets](/developers/tokens/zrc20) can be deposited. The
receiver gets the ZRC-20 version of the deposited token (e.g., ZRC-20 USDC.ETH).

The `amount` specifies the quantity, and `asset` is the token address of the
ERC-20 being deposited.

## Deposit Gas Tokens and Call a Universal App

To deposit tokens and call a universal app contract, use the `depositAndCall`
function:

```solidity
depositAndCall(address receiver, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external payable;
```

After the cross-chain transaction is processed, the `onCall` function of the
universal app contract is executed.

The `receiver` must be the address of a universal app contract.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/UniversalContract.sol";

contract UniversalApp is UniversalContract {
    function onCall(
        MessageContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override {
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the `onCall` function, the parameters are as follows:

- `message`: the value of the `payload`.
- `amount`: the amount of deposited tokens.
- `zrc20`: the ZRC-20 address of the deposited tokens (e.g., the contract
  address of ZRC-20 ETH).
- `context`:
  - `context.sender`: the sender address on the connected chain (the EOA or
    contract that called the Gateway).
  - `context.chainID`: the chain ID of the connected chain from which the call
    was made.

When calling a universal app, the `payload` is passed to `onCall` as `message`.
You do not need to include a function selector in the payload, since `onCall` is
the only function that can be called from a connected chain.

## Deposit ERC-20 Tokens and Call a Universal App

The `depositAndCall` function can also be used to call a universal app contract
and send ERC-20 tokens:

```solidity
depositAndCall(address receiver, uint256 amount, address asset, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

Here, `amount` specifies the quantity, and `asset` is the token address of the
ERC-20 being deposited.

In the current version of the protocol, only one ERC-20 asset can be deposited
at a time.

## Call a Universal App

To call a universal app without depositing tokens, use the `call` function:

```solidity
call(address receiver, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

The `call` function invokes the `onCall` function of the specified `receiver`
universal contract and passes the `payload` as the `message` parameter.

The `call` function doesn't support revert handling. If
`revertOptions.callOnRevert` is set to `true`, the call will fail because
calling a contract on revert requires tokens to cover gas fees, and the call
function is a no-asset call. If you need revert handling, consider using
`depositAndCall` instead.

## Revert Transactions

For information on `RevertOptions`, refer to the [ZetaChain "Revert
Transactions" documentation](/developers/chains/zetachain#revert-transactions).
