To interact with universal apps from EVM chains (like Ethereum, BNB, Polygon,
etc.) use the EVM gateway.

EVM gateway supports:

- depositing gas tokens to a universal app or an account on ZetaChain
- depositing supported ERC-20 tokens (including ZETA tokens)
- depositing gas tokens and calling a universal app
- depositing supported ERC-20 tokens and calling a universal app
- calling a universal app

## Deposit Gas Tokens

To deposit tokens to an EOA or a universal contract call the `deposit` function
of the Gateway contract.

```solidity
deposit(address receiver, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external payable;
```

The `deposit` function is payable, which means it accepts native gas tokens (for
example, ETH on Ethereum), which will then be sent to a `receiver` on ZetaChain.

The `receiver` is either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a universal app
address on ZetaChain. Even if the receiver is a universal app contract with the
standard `receive` function, the `deposit` function will not trigger a contract
call. If you want to deposit and call a universal app, please, use the
`depositAndCall` function, instead.

After the deposit is processed, the receiver gets [ZRC-20
version](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the deposited token, for example (ZRC-20
ETH).

## Deposit ERC-20 Tokens

The `deposit` function can also be used to send supported ERC-20 tokens to EOAs
and universal apps on ZetaChain.

```solidity
deposit(address receiver, uint256 amount, address asset, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

Only [supported ERC-20 assets](/developers/tokens/zrc20) can be deposited. The
receiver gets ZRC-20 version of the deposited token (for example, ZRC-20
USDC.ETH).

The `amount` is the amount and `asset` is the token address of the ERC-20 that
is being deposited.

## Deposit Gas Tokens and Call a Universal App

To deposit tokens and call a universal app contract use the `depositAndCall`
function.

```solidity
depositAndCall(address receiver, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external payable;
```

After the cross-chain transaction is processed, the `onCrossChainCall` function
of a universal app contract is executed.

The `receiver` must be a universal app contract address.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol";

contract UniversalApp is UniversalContract {
    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override {
        // ...
    }
}
```

`onCrossChainCall` receives:

- `message`: value of the `payload`
- `amount`: amount of deposited tokens
- `zrc20`: ZRC-20 address of a the deposited tokens (for example, contract
  address of ZRC-20 ETH)
- `context`:
  - `context.origin`: the original sender address on a connected chain (the EOA
    or contract that called the Gateway)
  - `context.chainID`: chain ID of the connected chain from which the call was
    made

## Deposit ERC-20 Tokens and Call a Universal App

`depositAndCall` can also be used to call a universal app contract and send
ERC-20 tokens.

```solidity
depositAndCall(address receiver, uint256 amount, address asset, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

The `amount` is the amount and `asset` is the token address of the ERC-20 that
is being deposited.

In the current version of the protocol only one ERC-20 asset can be deposited at
a time.

## Call a Universal App

To call a universal app (without depositing tokens), use the `call` function.

```solidity
call(address receiver, bytes calldata payload, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```
