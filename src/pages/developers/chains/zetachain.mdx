To make a call from a universal app to a contract on a connected chain or to
withdraw tokens, use the ZetaChain gateway.

ZetaChain gateway supports:

- withdrawing ZRC-20 tokens as native gas or ERC-20 tokens to connected chains
- withdrawing ZETA tokens to connected chains withdrawing tokens to and making a
  contract call on connected chains
- calling contracts on connected chains

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to an EOA or a contract on a connected chain, call the
`withdraw` function of the gateway contract.

```solidity
function withdraw(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

The `receiver` is either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a contract on a
connected chain. Even if the receiver is a smart contract with the standard
`receive` function, the `withdraw` function will not trigger a contract call. If
you want to withdraw and call a contract on a connected chain, please, use the
`withdrawAndCall` function, instead.

The `receiver` is of type `bytes`, because the receiver may be on a chain that
uses a different address type, for example, bech32 on Bitcoin. `bytes` allow the
receiver address to be chain agnostic. When withdrawing to a receiver on an EVM
chain make sure that you convert `address` to `bytes`.

The `amount` is the amount and `zrc20` is the ZRC-20 address of the token that
is being withdrawn.

You don't need to specify which chain to withdraw to, because each ZRC-20 has an
associated chain from which it was deposited. A ZRC-20 token can be withdrawn
only to the chain from which it was originally deposited. This means that if you
want to withdraw ZRC-20 USDC.ETH to the BNB chain, you first have to swap it to
ZRC-20 USDC.BNB.

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens and Call a Contract on Connected Chain

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens and make a call from a universal app to a contract on
a connected chain use the `withdrawAndCall` function of the gateway contract.

```solidity
function withdrawAndCall(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, CallOptions calldata callOptions, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions)
```

The tokens are withdrawn and a call is made to a contract on the connected chain
identified by the `zrc20` address. For example, if ZRC-20 ETH is being
withdrawn, then the call is made to a contract on Ethereum.

## Call a Contract on a Connected Chain

To call a contract on a connected chain (without withdrawing tokens), use the
`call` function.

```solidity
function call(bytes memory receiver, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, CallOptions calldata callOptions, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions)
```

`zrc20` represents the ZRC-20 token address of the gas token of the destination
chain. In the context of this function `zrc20` address acts as an identifier for
the chain to which the call is made. For example, to make a call to Ethereum,
use ZRC-20 ETH token address.

## Call Options

The `CallOptions` parameter provides details for making calls to contracts on
connected chains. `CallOptions` is applied in both `call` and `withdrawAndCall`
functions.

```solidity
struct CallOptions {
    uint256 gasLimit;
    bool isArbitraryCall;
}
```

`gasLimit` specifies the maximum amount of gas that a cross-chain contract call
can consume. If the gas usage exceeds this limit, the cross-chain transaction
will revert.

`isArbitraryCall` determines whether the call is "arbitrary" (`true`) or
"authenticated" (`false`).

An arbitrary call can invoke any function of any contract on a connected chain.
For instance, a universal app might call a `hello(string)` function on an
Ethereum contract. However, an arbitrary call does not retain the original
caller's identity—`msg.sender` within the called contract will point to the
Gateway address rather than the universal contract that initiated the call. This
lack of caller identification is often acceptable for operations like a swap in
a `withdrawAndCall`, where the swap function only needs to perform the token
swap and send it to the designated address, without needing to verify the
caller.

An authenticated call targets the `onCall` function on a connected chain’s
contract. Here, "authentication" is achieved because one of the `onCall`
parameters, `context.sender`, directly references the originating universal
contract. This enables the called contract to verify and establish a trusted
connection with the initiating universal contract, rejecting calls from any
unauthorized third-party contracts.

## Format of the `message` when Calling Contracts

The `withdrawAndCall` and `call` functions have a `bytes calldata message`
parameter. This parameter contains the function selector and the encoded
arguments necessary to call a specific function in the target contract.

The message parameter should contain:

- Function selector: the first 8 bytes represent the function selector, which is
  the first 4 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the function signature.
- Arguments: the remaining bytes in the message correspond to the arguments
  passed to the function, encoded according to Ethereum's ABI encoding rules.
  These arguments can vary in length depending on the data types.

For example, consider the following message:

```
0xa777d0dc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005616c696365000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

- Function Selector: `0xa777d0dc`. This corresponds to the function
  `hello(string)`.
- Arguments: The remaining data
  (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020...`) is the
  ABI-encoded argument passed to the `hello(string)` function. Specifically:
  `616c696365` represents the string `alice` in hexadecimal.

## Revert Transactions

The `RevertOptions` struct defines how assets should be handled in the event of
a cross-chain transaction (CCTX) reverting:

```solidity
struct RevertOptions {
    address revertAddress;
    bool callOnRevert;
    address abortAddress;
    bytes revertMessage;
    uint256 onRevertGasLimit;
}
```

`revertAddress`: the address that should get assets back if the CCTX reverts.
For example, if a smart contract using ZetaChain wants to send assets back to
the sender upon a revert, `revertAddress` should be set to `msg.sender`.

`callOnRevert`: a boolean flag indicating whether the `onRevert` function should
be called on the `revertAddress`. For example, a smart contract may want to
execute custom logic when a revert occurs, such as unlocking tokens. In this
case, the contract would set `callOnRevert` to true and assign `revertAddress`
to `address(this)`.

`abortAddress`: the address that will receive the funds on ZetaChain if the CCTX
aborts. This feature is not currently used.

`revertMessage`: message sent back to the `onRevert` function. This allows
additional context to be provided for handling the revert.

`onRevertGasLimit`: the gas limit to be used when executing the `onRevert`
function.

Contracts that implement the `onRevert` functionality are referred to as
`Revertable` contracts. These contracts should conform to the following
interface:

```solidity
struct RevertContext {
    address asset;
    uint64 amount;
    bytes revertMessage;
}

interface Revertable {
    function onRevert(RevertContext calldata revertContext) external;
}
```

This interface allows the contract to handle reverts in a customized way, based
on the context provided through the `RevertContext` struct.
