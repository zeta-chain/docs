To make a call from a universal app to a contract on a connected chain or
withdraw tokens, use the ZetaChain gateway.

The ZetaChain gateway supports:

- Withdrawing ZRC-20 tokens as native gas or ERC-20 tokens to connected chains.
- Withdrawing tokens and making a contract call on connected chains.
- Calling contracts on connected chains.

Note: Withdrawing ZETA tokens is currently not supported and will revert with
`ZETANotSupported()`.

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens to an EOA or a contract on a connected chain, use the
`withdraw` function of the gateway contract:

```solidity
function withdraw(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

The `receiver` can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a contract on
a connected chain. Even if the receiver is a smart contract with a standard
`receive` function, the `withdraw` function will not trigger a contract call. If
you need to withdraw and call a contract on a connected chain, use the
`withdrawAndCall` function instead.

The `receiver` is of type `bytes` to accommodate different address formats used
by various chains (e.g., Bech32 for Bitcoin). This type ensures the receiver
address is chain-agnostic. When withdrawing to an EVM chain, ensure you convert
`address` to `bytes`.

The `amount` specifies the quantity to withdraw, and `zrc20` is the ZRC-20
address of the token being withdrawn.

The `revertOptions.revertMessage` must not exceed 1024 bytes in length.

You don't need to specify the destination chain since each ZRC-20 token is tied
to the chain from which it was deposited. A ZRC-20 token can only be withdrawn
to its originating chain. For example, to withdraw ZRC-20 USDC.ETH to the BNB
chain, you must first swap it to ZRC-20 USDC.BNB.

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens and Call a Contract on a Connected Chain

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens and call a contract on a connected chain, use the
`withdrawAndCall` function:

```solidity
function withdrawAndCall(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, CallOptions calldata callOptions, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

This function withdraws tokens and makes a call to a contract on the connected
chain identified by the `zrc20` address. For instance, if ZRC-20 ETH is
withdrawn, the call is made to a contract on Ethereum.

The combined length of `message` and `revertOptions.revertMessage` must not
exceed 1024 bytes.

## Call a Contract on a Connected Chain

To call a contract on a connected chain without withdrawing tokens, use the
`call` function:

```solidity
function call(bytes memory receiver, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, CallOptions calldata callOptions, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

Here, `zrc20` represents the ZRC-20 token address of the gas token for the
destination chain. This address acts as an identifier for the target chain. For
example, to call a contract on Ethereum, use the ZRC-20 ETH token address.

The combined length of `message` and `revertOptions.revertMessage` must not
exceed 1024 bytes.

## Call Options

The `CallOptions` parameter specifies details for making calls to contracts on
connected chains. It is used in both the `call` and `withdrawAndCall` functions:

```solidity
struct CallOptions {
    uint256 gasLimit;
    bool isArbitraryCall;
}
```

- **`gasLimit`**: The maximum gas the cross-chain contract call can consume. If
  the gas usage exceeds this limit, the transaction reverts.
- **`isArbitraryCall`**: Determines whether the call is "arbitrary" (`true`) or
  "authenticated" (`false`).

An arbitrary call invokes any function on a connected chain but does not retain
the original caller's identity—within the target contract, `msg.sender` is the
Gateway address, not the originating universal contract. This is suitable for
scenarios like token swaps, where the caller's identity is unnecessary.

An authenticated call specifically targets the `onCall` function of a contract
on the connected chain. Authentication is achieved because the `onCall` function
receives the `context.sender` parameter, referencing the originating universal
contract. This allows the target contract to verify and trust the initiating
universal app, rejecting unauthorized calls.

## Format of the `message` Parameter

For arbitrary calls (when `isArbitraryCall` is `true`) the `message` parameter
in the `withdrawAndCall` and `call` functions contains the encoded function
selector and arguments for the target contract:

- **Function Selector**: The first 4 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the
  function signature.
- **Arguments**: The remaining bytes, ABI-encoded according to Ethereum's rules.

For example:

```
0xa777d0dc00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005616c696365000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

- **Function Selector**: `0xa777d0dc` corresponds to `hello(string)`.
- **Arguments**: The remaining data represents the argument `alice`, encoded in
  hexadecimal (`616c696365`).

For authenticated calls the `message` is just ABI-encoded arguments (no function
selector in the beginning, because authenticated calls are routed to a specific
`onCall` function).

## Revert Transactions

The `RevertOptions` struct specifies how assets are handled in case of a
cross-chain transaction (CCTX) revert:

```solidity
struct RevertOptions {
    address revertAddress;
    bool callOnRevert;
    address abortAddress;
    bytes revertMessage;
    uint256 onRevertGasLimit;
}
```

`revertAddress` is the address of an EOA or contract, which will receive the
tokens if a cross-chain transaction reverts. If a zero address is specified, the
tokens will be transferred the the `msg.sender` that initiated the Gateway call.
It's recommended to always specify the revert address to make sure tokens are
refunded to the correct address.

`callOnRevert` is a flag indicating whether a reverted cross-chain transaction
should result in a contract call on the chain on which the Gateway call was
made. If call on revert is true, the `onRevert` function of the `revertAddress`
contract is called. If call on revert is false, then a reverted cross-chain
transaction will make a token transfer to the revert address without a contract
call.

`abortAddress` is an address on ZetaChain, to which tokens are transferred if
reverting failed.

`revertMessage` is a message passed to the `onRevert` function inside the revert
context.

`onRevertGasLimit` is a limit for executing the `onRevert` function.

For CCTXs from ZetaChain to a connected chain, revert execution is free, so the
same amount that has been withdrawn will be returned back as
`revertContext.amount` in ZRC-20 tokens.

For CCTXS from a connected chain to ZetaChain, however, gas fees for revert
execution are deducted from the deposit amount. If a CCTX reverts, the protocol
will swap a fraction of the deposit amount into ZRC-20 gas tokens of the chain
on which the revert is to be executed. If the deposit amount is insufficient,
the CCTX will abort and `onRevert` will not be called.

Gateway `call` (no asset call) from a connected chain to ZetaChain does not
support reverts, because there are no assets to cover the revert gas costs. If
the execution of `onCall` (as a result of a no-asset `call`) in a universal
contract on ZetaChain reverts, `onAbort` is triggered.

Contracts implementing the `onRevert` function must conform to this interface:

```solidity
struct RevertContext {
    address asset;
    uint64 amount;
    bytes revertMessage;
}


interface Revertable {
    function onRevert(RevertContext calldata revertContext) external;
}
```

On a connected chain `asset` is an address of an ERC-20 deposited using
Gateway's `deposit` or `depositAndCall`. If a gas token was deposited, the
`asset` is a zero address.

On ZetaChain `asset` is an address of a ZRC-20 withdrawn using Gateway's
`withdraw` or `withdrawAndCall`.

## Abort Transactions

The `abortAddress` field in the `RevertOptions` struct specifies the address on
ZetaChain which is called in two scenarios:

```
Connected chain → ZetaChain, onCall reverts, amount not enough for revert → ZetaChain, onAbort
```

If a cross-chain call from a connected chain to ZetaChain (incoming call) is
reverted, but the amount of tokens supplied with the call is not enough to pay
for a revert transaction back to the source chain. This applies to all no-asset
calls as well as deposit and calls with insufficient amounts.

```
ZetaChain -> Connected chain, onCall reverts → ZetaChain, onRevert reverts → ZetaChain, onAbort
```

When a call from ZetaChain to a connected chain (outgoing call) is reverted, a
cross-chain call was made from connected chain to ZetaChain, which called
`onRevert`, and `onRevert` also reverted.

Tokens are transferred to onAbort address on ZetaChain, and if this address is a
contract it is called.

Contracts implementing the `onAbort` function must conform to this interface:

```solidity
struct AbortContext {
    bytes sender;
    address asset;
    uint256 amount;
    bool outgoing;
    uint256 chainID;
    bytes revertMessage;
}

interface Abortable {
    function onAbort(AbortContext calldata abortContext) external;
}
```
