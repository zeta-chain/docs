To make a call from a universal app to a contract on a connected chains or to
withdraw tokens, use the ZetaChain gateway.

ZetaChain gateway supports:

- withdrawing ZRC-20 tokens as native gas or ERC-20 tokens to connected chains
- withdrawing ZETA tokens to connected chains
- withdrawing tokens to and making a contract call on a connected chains
- calling contracts on connected chains

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens

```solidity
withdraw(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

To withdraw a ZRC-20 token to an EOA or a contract on a connected chain call the
`withdraw` function of the Gateway contract.

The `receiver` is either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a contract on a
connected chain. Even if the receiver is a smart contract with the standard
`receive` function, the `withdraw` function will not trigger a contract call. If
you want to withdraw and call a contract on a connected chain, please, use the
`withdrawAndCall` function, instead.

The `receiver` is of type `bytes`, because the receiver may be on a chain that
uses a different address type, for example, bech32 on Bitcoin. `bytes` allow the
receiver address to be chain agnostic. When withdrawing to a receiver on an EVM
chain make sure that you convert `address` to `bytes`.

The `amount` is the amount and `zrc20` is the ZRC-20 address of the token that
is being withdrawn.

You don't need to specify which chain to withdraw to, because each ZRC-20 has an
associated chain from which it was deposited. A ZRC-20 token can be withdrawn
only to the chain from which it was originally deposited. This means that if you
want to withdraw ZRC-20 USDC.ETH to the BNB chain, you first have to swap it to
ZRC-20 USDC.BNB.

## Withdraw ZETA Tokens

```solidity
withdraw(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

If the receiver address matches the sender address (when you are withdrawing
tokens to your own account on a connected chain), you can use the `withdraw`
function without specifying the `receiver`. This will only work when the
`receiver` address on the connected chain is an EVM hex address (as ZetaChain is
also EVM).

```
withdraw(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, uint256 chainId, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

## Withdraw ZRC-20 Tokens and Call a Contract on Connected Chain

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens and make a call from a universal app to a contract on
a connected chain use the `withdrawAndCall` function of the gateway contract.

```solidity
function withdrawAndCall(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, uint256 gasLimit, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

## Withdraw ZETA Tokens and Call a Contract on Connected Chain

To withdraw ZETA tokens and make a call from a universal app to a contract on a
connected chain use the `withdrawAndCall` function of the gateway contract.

```solidity
withdrawAndCall(bytes memory receiver, uint256 amount, uint256 chainId, bytes calldata message, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

## Call a Contract on a Connected Chain

```solidity
function call(bytes memory receiver, address zrc20, bytes calldata message, uint256 gasLimit, RevertOptions calldata revertOptions) external;
```

`zrc20` represents the ZRC-20 token address of the gas token of the destination
chain.
