Interacting with universal contracts on ZetaChain from Bitcoin happens through
the Bitcoin Gateway, a threshold signature scheme (TSS) address. The private key
to this address is distributed among ZetaChain's validator set using MPC.

The Bitcoin Gateway supports the following operations:

- Deposit: Send BTC to a ZetaChain account or contract.
- Call: Trigger a smart contract on ZetaChain using a BTC transaction.
- Deposit and Call: Deposit BTC and immediately invoke a contract.

There are two ways to interact with the Bitcoin Gateway:

| Method       | Max Payload  | Cost          | Revert Address | Best For                                   |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Inscriptions | 400 KB\*     | Higher (2 tx) | Customizable   | Structured cross-chain calls, custom logic |
| OP_RETURN    | 60 bytes\*\* | Lower (1 tx)  | Matches sender | Simple deposits and small data payloads    |

\* Limited only by Bitcoin's transaction and witness size limits. Typical
payloads range from 1‚Äì30 KB; larger payloads may not relay through standard
nodes.

\*\* Not counting the required 20 bytes for the universal contract address.

## Inscription Overview ‚ö°Ô∏è

Inscriptions enable rich interaction between Bitcoin and ZetaChain by embedding
structured metadata into Bitcoin transactions using a commit-reveal flow. This
method encodes ABI data and optional Bitcoin revert logic into the Bitcoin
blockchain.

Commit and Reveal Each interaction consists of two Bitcoin transactions:

- Commit: Encodes the payload as a Taproot-inscribed output. It commits to the
  data but doesn't reveal it yet.
- Reveal: Broadcasts the actual data that was committed to, including logic for
  contract interaction on ZetaChain.

**‚úâÔ∏è Envelope Format (Witness Script)**

```
OP_PUSHBYTES_32 <32-byte public key> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_FALSE
OP_IF
    OP_PUSH 0x...
    OP_PUSH 0x...
OP_ENDIF
```

**üß© Payload Format**

The inscription data consists of: a 4-byte ZetaChain header and ABI- or
Compact-encoded fields (depending on format).

**Header**

| Byte Index | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | Fixed identifier: `0x5a` (ASCII `'Z'`) for ZetaChain inscriptions                                  |
| 1          | Encoding format (lower nibble). Example: `0x00` = ABI, `0x01` = CompactShort, `0x02` = CompactLong |
| 2          | Operation code (upper nibble). Example: `0x10` for Call = `0x02 << 4`                              |
| 3          | Flags bitmask. Indicates which fields are set. Common value: `0x07` (receiver + payload + revert)  |

**Fields**

Fields are encoded differently based on the encoding format.

| Format                    | Value    |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| `EncodingFmtABI`          | `0b0000` |
| `EncodingFmtCompactShort` | `0b0001` |
| `EncodingFmtCompactLong`  | `0b0010` |

Compact encoding is space-efficient and can be useful when optimizing
transaction size. Use `CompactShort` when all dynamic fields (payload and revert
address) are under 255 bytes. Use `CompactLong` when any field may exceed that
threshold.

**ABI encoding**

For calls involving structured input, ZetaChain uses Ethereum-style ABI
encoding. This allows full compatibility with Solidity contracts. You can pass
complex types like address, bytes, uint256[], etc., and encode them client-side
before embedding them in the inscription.

- Receiver address: A 20-byte Ethereum-style address of the ZetaChain account or
  universal contract.
- Payload: Optional encoded data (e.g., an ABI-encoded function call) for use in
  the contract‚Äôs onCall handler.
- Revert address (optional): A Bitcoin address to return funds if the
  cross-chain call fails.

| Field    | Value                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Header   | 4 bytes                                      |
| ABI data | abi.encode(receiver, payload, revertAddress) |

Note: the ABI-encoded data must exclude the 4-byte function selector. Only the
packed argument values should be included in the payload.

**Compact encoding**

Each field is encoded in a more concise form:

```
[receiver (20 bytes)] + [len][payload bytes] + [len][revert address bytes]
```

- Receiver is raw 20 bytes
- Payload and Revert Address are length-prefixed:
  - CompactShort: 1-byte length prefix (max 255 bytes)
  - CompactLong: 2-byte length prefix (max 65535 bytes)

| Field    | Value                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Header   | 4 bytes                      |
| Receiver | 20 bytes                     |
| Payload  | [len:1 or 2] + bytes         |
| Revert   | [len:1 or 2] + address bytes |

**üîÅ Operation Types (OpCode)**

| Operation        | Code     | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deposit`        | `0b0010` | Only receiver, no payload. Optional revert address                   |
| `DepositAndCall` | `0b0000` | Transfers BTC and invokes onCall() with payload. Revert **required** |
| `Call`           | `0b0001` | Sends no BTC, invokes onCall() with payload. Revert optional         |
| `Invalid`        | `0b0011` | Reserved                                                             |

## Inscription: Deposit

- No call data is included.
- BTC is deposited to the ZRC-20 equivalent on ZetaChain.
- Useful when transferring BTC as ZRC-20 BTC to an EOA on ZetaChain

## Inscription: Call

- The encoded data includes:
  - Contract address (as receiver)
  - Payload
- No BTC is transferred to the contract ‚Äî it's a logic-only interaction.
- Ideal for triggering universal contract execution that does not require BTC

üìå **Example:**

- [Commit
  TX](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/6c92cb80f093176b865c1431770e43c9264074d797acabbfee244f96751aac61)
- [Reveal

## Inscriptions: Deposit and Call

- Combines the previous two:
  - BTC is transferred and
  - A contract function is invoked with encoded parameters.
- Enables rich interactions like "send BTC and trigger a swap", "deposit and
  mint", or any other cross-chain composable logic.

- [Commit

## When to Use Inscriptions

Use inscriptions when:

- Your payload exceeds 60 bytes (which OP_RETURN can‚Äôt handle)
- You need to encode structured ABI arguments
- You want to specify a custom revert address for fail-safety
- You‚Äôre triggering logic, not just transferring BTC

## Memo (OP_RETURN) Overview üíæ

This method involves sending a standard Bitcoin transaction with an `OP_RETURN`
output that encodes the recipient (universal contract or EOA) and an optional
short message.

To initiate a cross-chain transaction from Bitcoin, the transaction must have at
least two outputs:

1. **First output**: BTC amount sent to the Bitcoin Gateway (TSS) address.
2. **Second output**: `OP_RETURN PUSH_x [DATA]`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the transaction does not include both required outputs in the correct
> order, ZetaChain will not initiate the cross-chain transaction. The BTC will
> still be sent to the Gateway address, but no smart contract call or token
> minting will occur.

## Memo: Deposit

To deposit BTC as ZRC-20 BTC to an EOA or a universal contract on ZetaChain:

```
[DATA] = [EOA or contract address (20 bytes)]
```

üìå **Example:**

- [Transaction](https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/952d60fd9efc1aad4b87a8a7a6d57a972d49e084de8b5dc524e163216c11c04f)
- [Cross-chain
  TX](https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/crosschain/inboundHashToCctxData/952d60fd9efc1aad4b87a8a7a6d57a972d49e084de8b5dc524e163216c11c04f)

## Memo: Call

To call a universal contract on ZetaChain:

```
[DATA] = [contract address (20 bytes)] + [call payload (max 60 bytes)]
```

This will execute the `onCall` method on the target contract.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your payload is larger than 60 bytes consider using inscriptions
> instead.

## Memo: Deposit and Call

To deposit BTC and call a universal contract on ZetaChain:

```
[DATA] = [contract address (20 bytes)] + [call payload (max 60 bytes)]
```

## Fees

Unlike EVM-based chains, each deposited Bitcoin output incurs a fee when it is
spent. To address this, both the depositor and the withdrawer share the cost of
the spend. This fee is charged in advance as a deposit fee.

The Bitcoin deposit fee is calculated with the following formula:

```text
depositFee = (txFee / txVsize) * 68 vB * 2
```

Where:

- `txFee = totalInputValue - totalOutputValue`
- `txVsize` is the virtual size of the Bitcoin transaction.
