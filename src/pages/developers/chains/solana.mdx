To interact with universal applications from Solana, use the Solana Gateway. The
Solana Gateway supports:

- Depositing SOL to a universal app or an account on ZetaChain
- Depositing supported SPL tokens
- Depositing SOL and calling a universal app
- Depositing supported SPL tokens and calling a universal app

## Deposit SOL

To deposit SOL to an EOA or a universal contract, call the `deposit` instruction
of the Solana Gateway program:

```rust
pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<Deposit>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20], revert_options: Option<RevertOptions>) -> Result<()>
```

The `deposit` instruction accepts SOL (in lamports) which will then be sent to a
`receiver` on ZetaChain. Note that 1 SOL equals 1,000,000,000 lamports, so
ensure you convert SOL amounts to lamports when specifying the `amount`
parameter.

The `receiver` can be either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a universal
app address on ZetaChain. Even if the receiver is a universal app contract with
the standard `receive` function, the `deposit` instruction will not trigger a
contract call. If you want to deposit and call a universal app, use the
`deposit_and_call` instruction instead.

After the deposit is processed, the receiver receives the [ZRC-20
version](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the deposited token—for example, ZRC-20
SOL.

## Deposit SPL Tokens

To deposit SPL tokens to an EOA or a universal contract, call the
`deposit_spl_token` instruction:

```rust
pub fn deposit_spl_token(ctx: Context<DepositSplToken>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20], revert_options: Option<RevertOptions>) -> Result<()>
```

Only [supported SPL tokens](/developers/tokens/zrc20) can be deposited. The
receiver gets the ZRC-20 version of the deposited token (e.g., ZRC-20 USDC.SOL).
SPL tokens must be whitelisted before they can be deposited through the gateway.

The `amount` specifies the quantity of SPL tokens to deposit.

## Deposit SOL and Call a Universal App

To deposit SOL and call a universal app contract, use the `deposit_and_call`
instruction:

```rust
pub fn deposit_and_call(ctx: Context<Deposit>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20], message: Vec<u8>, revert_options: Option<RevertOptions>) -> Result<()>
```

After the cross-chain transaction is processed, the `onCall` function of the
universal app contract is executed.

The `receiver` must be the address of a universal app contract.

When calling a universal app, the `message` is passed to `onCall`.

## Deposit SPL Tokens and Call a Universal App

The `deposit_spl_token_and_call` instruction can be used to call a universal app
contract and send SPL tokens:

```rust
pub fn deposit_spl_token_and_call(ctx: Context<DepositSplToken>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20], message: Vec<u8>, revert_options: Option<RevertOptions>) -> Result<()>
```

Here, `amount` specifies the quantity of SPL tokens to deposit.

In the current version of the protocol, only one SPL token can be deposited at a
time.

## Call a Universal App

```rust
pub fn call(ctx: Context<Call>, receiver: [u8; 20], message: Vec<u8>, revert_options: Option<RevertOptions>) -> Result<()>
```

Use when you simply need to invoke logic on ZetaChain and no asset movement is
required.

## Revert Options

The Solana Gateway supports transaction revert options to handle failure
scenarios during cross-chain execution. You can pass an optional
`revert_options` argument to all Gateway instructions (`deposit`,
`deposit_spl_token`, `deposit_and_call`, etc.). This enables more granular
control over what happens when a cross-chain call fails on ZetaChain.

The `RevertOptions` struct is defined as:

```rust
pub struct RevertOptions {
    pub revert_address: Pubkey,
    pub abort_address: [u8; 20],
    pub call_on_revert: bool,
    pub revert_message: Vec<u8>,
    pub on_revert_gas_limit: u64,
}
```

### Fields

- `revert_address`: Solana `Pubkey` that receives the tokens back if the
  transaction fails on ZetaChain after being processed. This must be a valid SPL
  token or SOL account depending on the asset deposited.
- `abort_address`: 20-byte Ethereum-style address on ZetaChain that receives the
  tokens if the call to the universal contract’s onCall function fails and the
  protocol is unable to execute a revert back to Solana (e.g., due to
  insufficient gas, invalid revert path, or internal errors). This address acts
  as a final fallback to prevent asset loss. If call_on_revert is true, this
  address may also receive the revert message via the app’s onRevert function.
- `call_on_revert` boolean flag that determines whether the `on_revert` on
  Solana or `onAbort` on ZetaChain hook on the universal app should be called if
  the transaction fails.
- `revert_message`: arbitrary bytes to be passed to the `on_revert` on Solana
  and `onAbort` on ZetaChain functions. This can contain metadata about the
  original intent, failure reason, or any custom app-specific data.
- `on_revert_gas_limit`: the gas limit to allocate for the revert transaction on
  ZetaChain. Ensure this is sufficient for the `onRevert` hook to execute.

### Notes

- If `revert_options` is omitted, the default behavior in case of revert is to
  transfer the tokens back to the sender.
- To fully protect assets against loss of funds, we recommend always
  specifying `abort_address`.

## Withdraw and Call a Solana Program

To withdraw ZRC-20 tokens and call a Solana program from a universal app on
ZetaChain, use the `withdrawAndCall` function of the ZetaChain Gateway. The
program being called on Solana must implement an `on_call` function.

The `on_call` function must have the following signature:

```rust
pub fn on_call(
    ctx: Context<OnCall>,
    amount: u64,
    sender: [u8; 20],
    data: Vec<u8>,
) -> Result<()>
```

The function receives:

- `amount`: The amount of tokens being withdrawn
- `sender`: The address of the universal app on ZetaChain that initiated the
  call
- `data`: Additional data passed from the universal app

The program can handle both SOL and SPL token withdrawals. For SPL tokens, the
program must include the necessary token accounts and mint account in its
context.

When calling a Solana program from ZetaChain, the message payload must include
both the program accounts and the data to be passed to the program. The payload
is ABI-encoded as a tuple containing:

1. An array of account metadata, where each account is specified as:

   - `publicKey`: The Solana public key of the account
   - `isWritable`: Whether the account can be modified by the program

2. The data to be passed to the program's `on_call` function

The accounts array must include all required accounts for the program's
`on_call` function.

For SOL token withdrawals, the accounts array must include:

- Program PDA (writable)
- Gateway PDA (read-only)
- System program (read-only)

For SPL token withdrawals, the accounts array must include:

- Program PDA (writable)
- Program's associated token account (writable)
- Mint account (read-only)
- Gateway PDA (read-only)
- Token program (read-only)
- System program (read-only)

The data field can be any bytes that your program's `on_call` function expects
to receive.

For a complete example of how to call a Solana program from a universal app,
including message encoding and program implementation, check out the [Solana
example in the ZetaChain examples
repository](https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts/tree/main/examples/call/solana).

## Fees

A deposit fee of 2,000,000 lamports (0.002 SOL) is charged for all deposits.

## Error Handling

The Solana Gateway program includes several error codes to handle different
failure scenarios:

- `SignerIsNotAuthority`: The signer is not authorized to perform the action.
- `DepositPaused`: Deposits are currently paused.
- `NonceMismatch`: The provided nonce does not match the expected nonce.
- `TSSAuthenticationFailed`: The TSS signature verification failed.
- `DepositToAddressMismatch`: The deposit destination address does not match.
- `MessageHashMismatch`: The message hash verification failed.
- `MemoLengthExceeded`: The memo length exceeds the maximum allowed size.
- `SPLAtaAndMintAddressMismatch`: The SPL token account address does not match
  the expected address.
- `EmptyReceiver`: The receiver address is empty.
- `InvalidInstructionData`: The instruction data is invalid.

## Revert Transactions

The Solana Gateway supports transaction reverting in case of failures. If a
cross-chain call fails on the ZetaChain side, the deposited tokens will be
reverted back to the original sender on Solana.

universal apps, check out [the Solana tutorial](/developers/tutorials/solana).
