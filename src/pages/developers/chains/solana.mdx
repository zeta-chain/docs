To interact with universal applications from Solana, use the Solana Gateway. The
Solana Gateway allows you to deposit SOL (the native gas token of Solana) to an
externally-owned account (EOA) or a universal application on ZetaChain. You can
also deposit SOL and call a universal application in a single transaction using
the `deposit_and_call` instruction.

## Deposit SOL

To deposit SOL to an EOA or a universal application on ZetaChain, use the
`deposit` instruction of the Solana Gateway program.

```rust
pub fn deposit(ctx: Context<Deposit>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20]) -> Result<()>
```

- `amount`: The amount of SOL (in lamports) to deposit.
- `receiver`: An array of bytes containing the receiver's address

When you call the `deposit` instruction, the specified amount of SOL is
transferred from your account to the Solana Gateway's Program Derived Account
(PDA).

Example of Depositing SOL to an EOA:

```rust
let receiver_address: [u8; 20] = [/* receiver's ZetaChain address */];
let amount_in_lamports: u64 = 1_000_000; // Amount in lamports (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports)

gateway::deposit(
    ctx,
    amount_in_lamports,
    receiver_address,
)?;
```

To interact with the Solana Gateway from a frontend application, you can refer
to the [solanaDeposit function in the ZetaChain
Toolkit](https://github.com/zeta-chain/toolkit/blob/main/packages/client/src/solanaDeposit.ts).
This function demonstrates how to call the `deposit` instruction from the
frontend using Anchor and the Solana Web3.js library.

Depositing SOL using the Toolkit:

```
npx hardhat solana-deposit --amount 0.01 --recipient 0x2DCB13e7Eb5253fD5255Ce3CbCB199B48A0C7dD9
```

## Deposit SOL and Call Universal Apps

To deposit SOL to an EOA or a universal application on ZetaChain, use the
`deposit_and_call` instruction of the Solana Gateway program.

```rust
pub fn deposit_and_call(ctx: Context<Deposit>, amount: u64, receiver: [u8; 20], message: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()>
```

- `amount`: The amount of SOL (in lamports) to deposit.
- `receiver`: An array of bytes containing a universal contract address on
  ZetaChain.
- `message`: A message passed to the universal contract.

Depositing SOL and calling a universal contract using the Toolkit:

```
npx hardhat solana-deposit-and-call \
  --amount 0.1 \
  --recipient 0x162CefCe314726698ac1Ee5895a6c392ba8e20d3 \
  --types '["address", "bytes", "bool"]' 0x236b0DE675cC8F46AE186897fCCeFe3370C9eDeD 0x4955a3F38ff86ae92A914445099caa8eA2B9bA32 true
```

### Recommendation on Message Formatting

We recommend formatting the message payload using ABI encoding so that it can be
easily decoded in a universal application on ZetaChain. ABI encoding ensures
compatibility and standardization when transmitting data across different
platforms.

**Example of ABI Encoding:**

```typescript
const ethers = require("ethers");

// Define the parameter types and values
const paramTypes = ["uint256", "string"];
const paramValues = [12345, "Hello, ZetaChain!"];

// Encode the parameters
const encodedParams = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(paramTypes, paramValues);

// Convert to Buffer or Uint8Array as needed
const paramsBuffer = Buffer.from(encodedParams.slice(2), "hex"); // Remove '0x' prefix
```

## Additional Information

- **Lamports and SOL:** 1 SOL equals 1,000,000,000 lamports. Ensure you convert
  SOL amounts to lamports when specifying the `amount` parameter.
- **Program Derived Account (PDA):** The PDA is a special account used by the
  Solana Gateway program to manage deposited funds securely.

## Future Support

- **SPL Tokens:** Support for SPL tokens (Solana's native token standard) is
  coming soon. This will allow you to deposit SPL tokens and interact with
  universal applications on ZetaChain using these tokens.
- **Calling Solana Programs from Universal Applications:** In the future,
  universal applications on ZetaChain will be able to call Solana programs
  directly, enabling more complex cross-chain interactions.

## Error Handling

The Solana Gateway program includes several error codes to handle different
failure scenarios:

- `SignerIsNotAuthority`: The signer is not authorized to perform the action.
- `DepositPaused`: Deposits are currently paused.

## Revert Transactions

The Solana Gateway supports transaction reversion in case of failures. If a
cross-chain call fails on the ZetaChain side, the deposited SOL will be reverted
back to the original sender on Solana.

## Conclusion

The Solana Gateway provides a seamless way to interact with universal
applications on ZetaChain from Solana. By using the Gateway instruction, you can
deposit SOL and make cross-chain contract calls to universal applications on
ZetaChain.
