# Sui Gateway

To interact with universal applications from Sui chain, use the Sui Gateway.

For step-by-step examples of using the Sui gateway, see the [Sui
tutorial](/developers/tutorials/sui/).

The Sui Gateway supports:

- Depositing native SUI and other coins to a universal app or an account on
  ZetaChain
- Depositing coins and calling a universal app

## Deposit Coins

To deposit coins to an EOA or a universal contract on ZetaChain, use the
`deposit` function:

```move
public entry fun deposit<T>(
    gateway: &mut Gateway,
    coins: Coin<T>,
    receiver: String,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

The `deposit` function accepts any whitelisted coin type `T` (including native
SUI), which will be sent to the specified `receiver` on ZetaChain.

The `receiver` parameter should be a valid EVM-style address (0x-prefixed hex
string) representing either an externally-owned account (EOA) or a universal app
address on ZetaChain. Even if the receiver is a universal app contract, the
`deposit` function will not trigger a contract call. If you want to deposit and
call a universal app, use the `deposit_and_call` function instead.

After the deposit is processed, the receiver receives the ZRC-20 version of the
deposited token on ZetaChain.

## Deposit Coins and Call a Universal App

To deposit coins and call a universal app contract, use the `deposit_and_call`
function:

```move
public entry fun deposit_and_call<T>(
    gateway: &mut Gateway,
    coins: Coin<T>,
    receiver: String,
    payload: vector<u8>,
    ctx: &mut TxContext,
)
```

The `receiver` must be the address of a universal app contract on ZetaChain. The
`payload` parameter will be passed to the `onCall` function of the universal app
contract.

The maximum payload size is 1024 bytes. The transaction will fail if the payload
exceeds this limit.

## Administrative Functions

The Sui Gateway includes several administrative functions that require special
capability objects:

- `whitelist<T>` - Enables deposits for a new coin type (requires
  `WhitelistCap`)
- `withdraw<T>` - Called by the TSS address when tokens are withdrawn from
  ZetaChain to Sui. This function requires a special capability object
  (`WithdrawCap`) that is only held by the TSS nodes. The `nonce` parameter
  prevents replay attacks by ensuring each withdrawal is processed exactly once.
- `unwhitelist<T>` - Disables deposits for a coin type (requires `AdminCap`)
- `pause` - Temporarily disables all deposits (requires `AdminCap`)
- `unpause` - Re-enables deposits (requires `AdminCap`)
- `issue_withdraw_and_whitelist_cap` - Rotates the TSS capabilities (requires
  `AdminCap`)

## Events

The Gateway emits several events that can be monitored:

- `DepositEvent` - Emitted when coins are deposited
- `DepositAndCallEvent` - Emitted when coins are deposited with a contract call
- `WithdrawEvent` - Emitted when coins are withdrawn
- `NonceIncreaseEvent` - Emitted when the withdrawal nonce is increased

## View Functions

The Gateway provides several read-only functions:

- `nonce()` - Returns the current withdrawal nonce
- `vault_balance<T>()` - Returns the balance of a specific coin type in the
  gateway
- `is_whitelisted<T>()` - Checks if a coin type is enabled for deposits
- `is_paused()` - Checks if deposits are currently paused
