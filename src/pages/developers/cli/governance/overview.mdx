# Overview

ZetaChain uses the standard Cosmos SDK [`gov` governance
module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/) to manage the network.
This module allows for the creation of proposals, which can be voted on by
stakers of the network. This guide will walk you through the process of creating
proposals using the ZetaChain's `zetacored` CLI.

## Making a Proposal

To make a proposal you will need to:

- Create a `proposal.json` file. The contents of the proposal file depends on
  the type of a proposal: [text proposal](/developers/cli/governance/text),
  [parameter change proposal](/developers/cli/governance/parameter), [software
  upgrade proposal](/developers/cli/governance/upgrade), etc.
- Create and publish a `metadata.json` file to IPFS or the web and submit the
  proposal using `zetacored tx gov submit-proposal` command. Learn about this
  step on the [Submit a Proposal](/developers/cli/governance/submit) page

  Check out the [text proposal](/developers/cli/governance/text) doc to learn more about the basics of how proposals are
  structured.

## Proposal Stages

The lifecycle of a proposal consists of the following stages:

1. **Deposit Period**: During this period, any user can deposit tokens to a
   proposal. If the proposal reaches the required deposit amount, it will move
   to the **voting period**. If the proposal does not reach the required deposit
   amount, it will be marked as "Rejected". As a creator of a proposal, you can
   supply your proposal with the deposit (equal or higher than the min deposit
   param) to immediately move to the voting period.
2. **Voting Period**: During this period, stakers can vote on the proposal. If
   the proposal does not reach the required quorum or does not pass until the
   voting period ends, it will be marked as "Rejected". If the proposal reaches
   the required quorum and passes, it will be executed. If the proposal executed
   successfully, it will be marked as "Passed". If the proposal executed
   unsuccessfully, it will be marked as "Failed".

The deposit amounts will be returned to the depositors, unless the proposal was
vetoed, or never entered voting period (minimum deposit not reached within
deposit period).
