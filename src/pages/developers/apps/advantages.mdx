ZetaChain empowers developers to create universal applications that seamlessly
interact with any blockchain. Whether it's Ethereum, BNB chain, Solana, TON, or
even non-smart contract chains like Bitcoin, ZetaChain allows your apps to
operate across them all with ease.

Universal apps built on ZetaChain benefit from simplified cross-chain
development, enhanced security, and a significantly improved user experience.

### Chain Orchestration

Universal apps can orchestrate complex cross-chain transactions that span across
different networks from a single contract on ZetaChain. A universal app can
handle incoming cross-chain token transfers and contract calls and produce
outgoing transactions on connected blockchains.

### Forwards Compatibility

When an app is deployed on ZetaChain, it's automatically connected to all
networks connected to ZetaChain. When a new blockchain is connected, the same
universal app becomes compatible with this blockchain without any modifications
required to the contract source code. This forwards compatibility makes
universal apps easier to maintain and future-proof.

### EVM Developer Experience

Smart contracts are running on ZetaChain's Universal EVM, which is fully
compatible with Ethereum and offers familiar developer experience. Foundry,
Hardhat, Slither, Ethers.js and other tools work out of the box and make
building universal apps a breeze.
