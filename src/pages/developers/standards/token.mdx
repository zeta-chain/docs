Universal Tokens are fully interoperable ERC-20 tokens that can be minted and
transferred across any connected chain without wrapping or bridging. Each token
retains its supply and metadata across chains, enabling true chain-agnostic
fungibility and seamless use in multichain DeFi, payments, and governance
systems.

Universal Tokens on ZetaChain are built on the standard [OpenZeppelin
ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc20)
implementation and use [UUPS
upgradeable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy#UUPSUpgradeable)
proxy patterns, allowing developers to extend and upgrade token logic safely
over time.

## Create a New Universal Token

Create a new Universal Token project:

```
npx zetachain@next new --project token
```

Install dependencies:

```
cd token
yarn
```

Compile Contracts:

```
npx hardhat compile --force
```

## Upgrade an Existing ERC-20 Project

You can upgrade your existing ERC-20 project to become a Universal Token by
installing the official standard contracts package:

```bash
yarn add @zetachain/standard-contracts
```

Then, update your contract using the [example
implementation](https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts/tree/main/examples/token/contracts)
as a referenceâ€”see the commented lines that include Universal Token-specific
logic for ZetaChain integration.

This allows your token to support cross-chain minting, transfers, and persistent
supply tracking across ZetaChain and connected EVM chains.
