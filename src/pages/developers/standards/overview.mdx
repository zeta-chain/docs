The Universal NFT and Token standards enable non-fungible tokens (ERC-721 NFTs)
and fungible tokens (ERC-20) to be minted on any chain and seamlessly
transferred between connected chains.

For simplicity, we'll refer to both Universal NFTs and Universal Tokens as
"assets" throughout this document.

When transferring assets between chains, an asset is burned on the source chain.
The asset's metadata and information are sent in a message to the asset contract
on the destination chain, where a corresponding asset is minted.

Both Universal NFT and Universal Token projects consist of two contracts:
**Universal** and **Connected**.

The Universal contract is deployed on ZetaChain. It is used to:

- Mint assets on ZetaChain
- Transfer assets from ZetaChain to a connected chain
- Handle incoming asset transfers from a connected chain to ZetaChain
- Handle asset transfers between connected chains

The Connected contract is deployed on one or more connected EVM chains. It is
used to:

- Mint assets on a connected chain
- Transfer assets to another connected chain or ZetaChain
- Handle incoming asset transfers from ZetaChain or another connected chain

A Universal contract deployment on ZetaChain is required, while Connected
contracts can be deployed as needed to enable asset transfers for specific
chains.

A universal asset can be minted on any chain — ZetaChain or any connected EVM
chain.

For Universal NFTs, when an asset is minted, it receives a persistent ID that is
unique across all chains. This ID remains unchanged when the asset is
transferred between chains.

Assets can be transferred from ZetaChain to a connected chain, from a connected
chain to ZetaChain, and between connected chains. ZetaChain acts as a hub for
cross-chain transactions, so all transfers are routed through it. For example,
when transferring an asset from Ethereum to BNB, two cross-chain transactions
are initiated: Ethereum → ZetaChain → BNB. This does not affect transfer time or
cost, but it allows the system to scale linearly as more chains are added.

Cross-chain asset transfers support reverts. If the transfer fails on the
destination chain, the asset is returned to the original sender on the source
chain.

Asset contracts only accept cross-chain calls from trusted contracts. Each
contract on a connected chain stores the address of the Universal contract on
ZetaChain. The Universal contract, in turn, stores the addresses of the
connected contracts on other chains. This ensures that only contracts from the
same asset collection can participate in cross-chain transfers.

Here’s the flow using a Universal NFT as an example:

## Deployment

1. Deploy the **Universal** contract on ZetaChain. This is a required step, as
   ZetaChain acts as the hub for all cross-chain transfers, even between
   connected EVM chains.
2. Deploy a **Connected** contract on a supported EVM chain (e.g., Ethereum,
   Base, Polygon, BNB).
3. On a universal contract on ZetaChain, run `setConnected(zrc20, connectedAddress)`, where:
   - `zrc20` is the [ZRC-20 contract](/developers/tokens/zrc20) of the gas token
     for the target EVM chain. This acts as a chain identifier.
   - `connectedAddress` is the address of the **Connected** contract on the EVM
     chain (from step 2).
4. On the connected EVM chain, run
   `ConnectedAsset.setUniversal(universalAddress)`, where `universalAddress` is
   the address of the **Universal** contract on ZetaChain (from step 1).

You now have trusted asset contracts deployed and linked on ZetaChain and a
connected EVM chain.

To enable transfers to additional EVM chains, repeat steps 2 and 3 for each new
chain.

> `setConnected` and `setUniversal` are required to establish a secure trust
> relationship between the asset contracts. Each contract verifies that
> cross-chain calls originate from a trusted counterpart.

## Gas Fees

- **EVM → ZetaChain:** No cross-chain fee is charged.
- **ZetaChain → EVM:** A cross-chain fee is paid in **ZETA**, based on the
  ZRC-20 withdraw fee for the destination chain. ZETA is automatically swapped
  to the destination chain's gas token ZRC-20 to cover execution.
- **EVM → EVM:** A cross-chain fee is paid in the **gas token of the source
  chain**. For example, if transferring an asset from Ethereum to BNB, the fee
  is paid in ETH. ZetaChain uses ZRC-20 ETH to cover the execution and swaps it
  for ZRC-20 BNB to call the destination chain.

## Revert Handling

If a cross-chain transfer fails on the destination chain (e.g., due to
out-of-gas, contract rejection, or network error), the asset is **reverted to
the original sender**.

When a transfer between two connected EVM chains fails, the asset is reverted to
the **original sender on ZetaChain**, rather than the original source chain.
This avoids costly return operations to the EVM chain where the transfer
started. The sender can then initiate a new transfer to the same or another
chain.
