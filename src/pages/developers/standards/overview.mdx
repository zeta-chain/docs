The Universal NFT and Token standards enable non-fungible tokens (ERC-721 NFT)
and fungible tokens (ERC-20) to be minted on any chain and seamlessly
transferred between connected chains.

For simplicity, we'll refer to both Universal NFTs and Universal Tokens as
"assets" throughout this document.

When transferring assets between chains, an asset is burned on the source chain.
The asset's metadata and information are sent in a message to the asset contract
on the destination chain, where a corresponding asset is minted.

Both Universal NFT and Universal Token projects consist of two contracts:
**Universal** and **Connected**.

Universal contract is deployed on ZetaChain. The contract is used to:

- Mint assets on ZetaChain
- Transfer assets from ZetaChain to a connected chain
- Handle incoming asset transfers from connected chain to ZetaChain
- Handle asset transfers between connected chains

Connected contract is deployed on one or more connected EVM chains. The contract
is used to:

- Mint an asset on a connected chain
- Transfer asset to another connected chain or ZetaChain
- Handling incoming asset transfers from ZetaChain or another connected chain

A Universal contract deployment on ZetaChain is required, while Connected
contracts can be deployed as needed to enable asset transfers for specific
chains.

A universal asset can be minted on any chain: ZetaChain or any connected EVM
chain.

For Universal NFTs, when an asset is minted, it gets assigned a persistent ID
that is unique across all chains. When an asset is transferred between chains,
the ID remains the same.

An asset can be transferred from ZetaChain to a connected chain, from a
connected chain to ZetaChain and between connected chains. ZetaChain acts as a
hub for cross-chain transactions, so all transfers go through ZetaChain. For
example, when you transfer an asset from Ethereum to BNB, two cross-chain
transactions are initiated: Ethereum → ZetaChain → BNB. This doesn't impact the
transfer time or costs, but makes it easier to connect any number of chains as
the number of connections grows linearly.

Cross-chain asset transfers are capable of handling reverts. If the transfer
fails on the destination chain, an asset will be returned to the original sender
on the source chain.

Asset contracts only accept cross-chain calls from trusted asset contracts. Each
contract on a connected chain stores a universal contract address — an address
of the Universal contract on ZetaChain. The Universal contract stores a list of
connected contracts on connected chains. This ensures that only the contracts
from the same asset collection can participate in the cross-chain transfer.

Here's a the flow using Universal NFT as an example:
