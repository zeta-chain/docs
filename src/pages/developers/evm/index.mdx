title: "Universal EVM"
---

ZetaChain is a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain built with the [Cosmos
SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), the [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com/)
consensus engine, and [Cosmos EVM](https://evm.cosmos.network/).

This stack delivers:

- Modularity: via the Cosmos SDK for flexible, upgradeable architecture.
- Fast finality: through CometBFT’s instant consensus mechanism
- Full EVM compatibility: with Cosmos EVM, enabling Ethereum smart contracts to
  run natively on ZetaChain without modification.

ZetaChain acts as a universal connector between blockchains, offering fast
~4-second blocks, instant finality, and throughput up to hundreds of
transactions per second, all on infrastructure purpose-built for secure,
seamless cross-chain interactions.

## Architecture Overview

### Hub-and-Spoke Model

ZetaChain uses a hub-and-spoke architecture:

- Hub: ZetaChain, the main coordination layer for all cross-chain activity.
- Spokes: External blockchains (EVM, Solana, Sui, Ton, and Bitcoin) connected
  with standardized protocols.

All cross-chain messages and transactions pass through ZetaChain, ensuring
consistent handling, easier integration of new chains, and a single point for
enforcing security and validation rules.

### Validators

ZetaChain’s validator set includes two main roles:

**Core Validators**

- Run ZetaChain node.
- Participate in CometBFT consensus to produce blocks and maintain state.
- Open to anyone staking the required ZETA tokens.
- Incentivized via transaction fees and rewards; subject to slashing for
  malicious or negligent behavior.

**Observer-Signer Validators**

- Run both ZetaChain node and ZetaClient.
- Monitor ZetaChain and connected chains for cross-chain events.
- Vote on event validity; upon majority agreement, coordinate outbound
  transactions.
- Sign outbound transactions using a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) so no
  single validator controls the signing key.

## Modules and Components

ZetaChain's functionality is organized into several key modules, each
responsible for specific aspects of cross-chain transaction processing.

### CrossChain Module

The CrossChain module manages the state and lifecycle of cross-chain
transactions (CCTX), serving as the central ledger for tracking their progress
and statuses. It handles the creation of new cross-chain transaction records
when inbound events are validated, updates transaction statuses based on events
(such as `PendingInbound`, `PendingOutbound`, `OutboundMined`), and stores
detailed parameters for both inbound and outbound transactions, including sender
and receiver information, asset details, and transaction hashes.

### Observer Module

The Observer module handles the operations of the observer set, including
validator management, voting mechanisms, and consensus policies. It maintains a
list of authorized observers eligible to participate in the consensus process,
creates and tracks ballots for each observed event to facilitate the voting
process, and defines core parameters such as ballot thresholds, minimum observer
delegation, and supported chains.

### Fungible Module

The Fungible module facilitates the deployment and management of fungible tokens
(ZRC20 tokens) representing assets from connected blockchains on ZetaChain. It
handles the deployment of ZRC20 contracts corresponding to foreign coins from
connected chains, manages pools and liquidity for these tokens, and provides
functions for depositing to and calling omnichain smart contracts on ZetaChain
from connected chains.

### Emissions Module

The Emissions module orchestrates the distribution of rewards to network
participants, including observers, validators, and TSS signers. It calculates
rewards based on participation metrics and predefined parameters, distributes
rewards from a pre-funded emissions pool, and allows participants to securely
withdraw their earned rewards.

### Authority Module

The Authority module encapsulates logic for administrative functions and
permission checks, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform sensitive
actions. It maintains tables for different admin groups and their permissions,
validates whether a user or entity has the necessary permissions to execute
specific actions, and facilitates changes to admin groups or permissions through
governance proposals, ensuring transparent and decentralized decision-making.

## Protocol Contracts

To enable interaction between users, applications, and the ZetaChain network,
protocol contracts are deployed both on ZetaChain and on connected external
chains. These contracts provide standardized entry points for initiating and
managing cross-chain transactions, as well as registry data for discovering
deployed protocol components.

**On ZetaChain**

| Contract         | Purpose                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GatewayZEVM      | Primary entry point for outbound transactions. Handles asset withdrawals, external contract calls, and ZRC-20 mint/burn logic.            |
| ZRC-20           | ERC-20–compliant tokens representing assets from connected chains, enabling fungible asset transfers within ZetaChain.                    |
| ContractRegistry | Stores and provides metadata for deployed protocol contracts (e.g., gateway, ZRC-20s) to ensure consistent references across the network. |

**On Connected EVM Chains**

| Contract         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GatewayEVM       | Entry point for inbound transactions. Handles deposits, contract calls to ZetaChain, and emits events for observers to track.                                |
| ERC20Custody     | Holds ERC-20 assets deposited for cross-chain transfers, ensuring secure custody until transactions are processed.                                           |
| ContractRegistry | Stores and provides metadata for deployed protocol contracts on the connected chain, allowing clients and services to locate the correct contract addresses. |

**On Other Connected Chains (Solana, Sui, TON, etc.)**

| Contract | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gateway  | Entry point for initiating and receiving cross-chain transactions between the connected chain and ZetaChain. Functions are adapted to the chain’s native runtime (e.g., Solana program, Sui Move module, TON smart contract). |

You can find up-to-date contract addresses for both mainnet and testnet in the
[Contract Addresses Reference](/reference/network/contracts/).

## Economic Incentives and Bonded Stakes

ZetaChain employs bonded stakes and positive/negative incentives to ensure
economic safety and encourage validators to act honestly. Validators are
required to stake bonds in the form of ZETA tokens, which are at risk if they
act maliciously or negligently. This staking mechanism aligns the interests of
validators with the network's health and security.

Validators earn transaction fees and block rewards in return for their services
in processing transactions and maintaining network security. Those who act
dishonestly or fail to fulfill their duties can have a portion of their staked
bonds slashed as a penalty. Positive incentives are provided to encourage
validators to remain online and actively participate in consensus and
observation processes.

## Cross-Chain Transaction Workflow

Cross-chain transactions are at the core of ZetaChain’s functionality, enabling
assets and data to move between ZetaChain and connected blockchains.

The process differs for **incoming** (connected chain → ZetaChain) and
**outgoing** (ZetaChain → connected chain) transactions, but both follow a
secure, validator-driven workflow.

### Incoming Transactions (Connected Chain → ZetaChain)

1. Initiation: A user interacts with the gateway contract on a connected chain
   (e.g., deposits assets or makes a cross-chain call).
2. Observation: Observer-Signer Validators detect the emitted event and extract
   transaction details.
3. Voting: Validators submit and vote on a ballot in ZetaChain; a majority is
   required for approval.
4. Execution on ZetaChain: Once approved, ZetaChain updates the CCTX record,
   mints assets (if applicable), and/or calls the target universal contract.

### Outgoing Transactions (ZetaChain → Connected Chain)

1. Initiation: A user or contract calls the `GatewayZEVM` contract on ZetaChain,
   specifying the target chain, recipient, assets, and payload.
2. Preparation: Validators process the request, validate parameters, and
   generate the outbound transaction.
3. TSS Signing: A subset of validators collaboratively sign the outbound
   transaction using Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), ensuring no single
   validator holds the private key.
4. Submission: The signed transaction is broadcast to the destination chain.
5. Completion or Revert:

   - On success: Assets or data are delivered, and the CCTX is marked complete.
   - On failure: ZetaChain executes revert logic per developer-defined options
     (e.g., refund assets, trigger fallback contract calls).

## Conclusion

For developers, ZetaChain removes much of the friction of building cross-chain
applications. Instead of juggling different SDKs, bridges, and security models,
you get a single platform that handles cross-chain messaging, asset movement,
and contract calls for you. Fast finality and a unified protocol mean you can
focus on application logic, not infrastructure. Whether your app needs to reach
EVM chains, Solana, Sui, or even Bitcoin, ZetaChain gives you one place to build
and deploy, with security and scalability baked in from the start.
