ZetaChain uses two mechanisms to manage liquidity throughput and ensure secure transaction handling:

- Liquidity caps for incoming transactions
- Rate limiting for outgoing transactions

These mechanisms are important for maintaining the stability and reliability of
the network, especially during periods of high transaction volume. By using
liquidity caps for incoming transactions and rate limiting for outgoing
transactions, ZetaChain can control the flow of tokens into and out of the
network. This prevents abuse, safeguards the network from potential liquidity
shocks, and ensures the system can handle high transaction loads without
compromising performance or security.

## Incoming Transactions: Liquidity Caps

For transactions coming into ZetaChain from a connected chain, ZetaChain uses a
mechanism called liquidity caps. Each supported token on ZetaChain has a
predefined maximum amount, or cap, that can be sent to ZetaChain. If the cap is
reached, any further transactions attempting to send more tokens to ZetaChain
will be reverted. Each supported token has its own cap, and transactions
exceeding the cap are reverted. The current liquidity caps for supported tokens
can be accessed through the chain's API: on
[testnet](https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/fungible/foreign_coins)
and [mainnet
beta](https://zetachain.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/fungible/foreign_coins).

## Outgoing Transactions: Rate Limiter

For transactions from ZetaChain to a connected chain, ZetaChain employs a rate
limiter mechanism. This mechanism ensures that the total number of tokens
withdrawn within a specified sliding window of ZetaChain blocks does not exceed
a predefined global limit. The rate limiter operates within a sliding window
defined in ZetaChain blocks, and there is a global limit denominated in ZETA
(rate) per block. The total amount of withdrawals for all tokens combined within
a single window cannot exceed the rate multiplied by the number of window
blocks.

Each ZRC-20 token has a conversion rate to ZETA. For example, if a ZRC-20 token
XYZ has a conversion rate of 2, withdrawing 10 XYZ will be counted as 20 ZETA
towards the limit. The current rate limiter parameters can be accessed through
the rate limiter flags endpoint: on
[testnet](https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/crosschain/rateLimiterFlags)
and [mainnet
beta](https://zetachain.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/crosschain/rateLimiterFlags).

These mechanisms ensure that ZetaChain can efficiently manage liquidity, prevent
abuse, and maintain the stability of the network during periods of high
transaction volume.
