title: ERC-20 on ZetaChain
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

ZetaChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) token
contracts can be deployed to ZetaChain permissionlessly.

<Alert variant="note">
  {" "}
  An ERC-20 token deployed to ZetaChain **does not** have the properties of [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20), specifically,
  it can't be withdrawn from ZetaChain to a connected chain.{" "}
