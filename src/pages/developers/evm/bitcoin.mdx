# Call Universal Apps from Bitcoin

<Alert variant="tip">This section is important for wallet and app developers.</Alert>

<Alert variant="tip">
  All inputs and outputs of Bitcoin transactions sent to TSS address must be a P2WPKH address (SegWit bech32 address,
  such as bc1xxx on Bitcoin mainnet). Otherwise the transactions will not be observed and there will be no refund, and
  may cause irreversible user fund loss.
</Alert>

To deposit BTC into ZetaChain's Universal EVM (and optionally call a smart
contract), the Bitcoin transaction must conform to this specifications:

1. The Bitcoin transaction must have at least 2 outputs.
2. The first output must be addressed to the TSS Bitcoin address.
3. The second output must be a memo output, i.e. `OP_RETURN PUSH_x [DATA]`. This
   output must be less than 80 bytes.
4. The memo `[DATA]` is an array of bytes that encodes the recipient address of
   this deposit into ZRC-20 or the smart contract on ZetaChain's EVM that will
   be invoked by this transaction.
5. If the purpose of this Bitcoin transaction is to only deposit BTC into the
   BTC ZRC-20 on ZetaChain's EVM, then the `[DATA]` should be exactly 20 bytes
   long, consists of an Ethereum-style address.
6. If the purpose of this Bitcoin transaction is to deposit BTC and also use the
   deposited amount to call a smart contract on ZetaChain's EVM, then the
   `[DATA]` field must consists of a smart contract address, and a binary
   message that will be forwarded to the said smart contract: `[DATA] =
   [ZetaChain's EVM contract address (20B)]
   - [arbitrary binary message]`

## Example 1: Deposit BTC into an account on ZetaChain's EVM

[Here's](https://blockstream.info/testnet/tx/952d60fd9efc1aad4b87a8a7a6d57a972d49e084de8b5dc524e163216c11c04f?expand)
an example Bitcoin transaction on Bitcoin Testnet that deposits 0.0005 tBTC
(50000 sats) into the address (0x)6da30bfa65e85a16b05bce3846339ed2bc746316.

Note the three outputs:

1. sending the intended amount (50000sats) to the current TSS Bitcoin address
   tb1qy9pqmk2pd9sv63g27jt8r657wy0d9ueeh0nqur.
2. the memo output, encoding the recipient address on ZetaChain's EVM
   (0x)6a146da30bfa65e85a16b05bce3846339ed2bc746316.
3. change sent back to the user.

If you're using ZetaChain's Hardhat [smart contract
template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template), you can use the `send-btc`
task to transfer BTC:

```
npx hardhat send-btc --recipient tb1qy9pqmk2pd9sv63g27jt8r657wy0d9ueeh0nqur --amount 0.0005 --memo 6a146da30bfa65e85a16b05bce3846339ed2bc746316
```

Where `recipient` is the TSS Bitcoin address, `amount` is the amount of tBTC to
transfer, and `memo` is the recipient address on ZetaChain's EVM.

## Example 2: Deposit BTC and call a smart contract on ZetaChain's EVM

<Alert variant="tip">
  In order to test with Bitcoin, you will need to use a wallet that allows setting an `OP_RETURN` and memos in a binary
  format. Please see our wallet suggestions [here](/reference/wallets).
</Alert>

If invalid information is sent (i. e. invalid address), the assets may be lost
and not recoverable.

In summary, a ZetaChain's EVM BTC transaction would look like this:

1. A user sends 1 BTC on Bitcoin network to the Bitcoin [TSS
   address](/reference/contracts) , adding a memo (via `OP_RETURN`) in the tx
   saying (colloquially) “deposit to 0x1337”.
2. Upon receiving this tx, the ZetaCore state machine calls the deposit (0x1337,
   1e8) to mint and credit 0x1337 with 1 zBTC minus fees.
3. If 0x1337 is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), that's it. If it's a
   contract, ZetaCore will call the `onCrossChainMessage` function sending the
   message that was specified in the `OP_RETURN` memo.

The TSS address holds the BTC, where ownerships are tracked inside this BTC
ZRC-20 contract.
