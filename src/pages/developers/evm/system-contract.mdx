title: System Contract

The System Contract on ZetaChain serves as the caller for universal apps when
they are called from connected chains.

| Network      | System contract address                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Testnet      | 0xEdf1c3275d13489aCdC6cD6eD246E72458B8795B |
| Mainnet Beta | 0x91d18e54DAf4F677cB28167158d6dd21F6aB3921 |

The `onlySystem` modifier must be applied to the `onCrossChainCall` function to
ensure that only the system contract can call this function.

Useful values and functions in the system contract:

- `wZetaContractAddress`: wrapped ZETA address.
- `uniswapv2Router02Address`: address of the Uniswap v2 router, which powers the
  internal liquidity pools.
- `uniswapv2FactoryAddress`: address of the Uniswap v2 factory.
- `gasZetaPoolByChainId`: returns a pool address of ZETA and a gas token of the
  specified chain.
- `gasCoinZRC20ByChainId`: returns a ZRC-20 address of the gas token of the
  specified chain.
- `gasPriceByChainId`: helper to estimate gas for transactions on connected
  chains.
- `zetaConnectorZEVMAddress`: address of the connector contract. (please, note
  that this value is currently empty, but will be set with the actual connector
  address in the next protocol upgrade)

The system contract is inherited from `ZetaChain`, making it easily accessible
from your universal app contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/IZRC20.sol";
import "@zetachain/protocol-contracts/contracts/zevm/interfaces/zContract.sol";

contract YourContract is zContract {
    function onCrossChainCall(
        zContext calldata context,
        address zrc20,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata message
    ) external virtual override {
        // systemContract.gasCoinZRC20ByChainId(context.chainID)
    }
}
```

To get the system contract address in a client-side application or script, use
the `getAddress` function:

```ts
import { getAddress } from "@zetachain/protocol-contracts";

const SYSTEM_CONTRACT = getAddress("systemContract", "zeta_testnet");
```
