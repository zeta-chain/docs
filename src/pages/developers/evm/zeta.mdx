## Native ZETA Token on ZetaChain

The native token of the ZetaChain is called ZETA. It is a staking token, and is
used to pay for transaction fees. ZetaChain node is built with Cosmos SDK
framework and the ZETA token is implemented as a `sdk.Coin`. ZETA is the
user-friendly symbol for the token, and the on-chain denom is `azeta`.

1 ZETA = 10¹⁸ azeta.

To query for account balance you can use the Cosmos HTTP API
[`balances` endpoint](https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/balances/zeta19nfaqu9wr0fktyyampva98ec025kjy0phww5um):

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "denom": "azeta",
      "amount": "10000000000000000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

To convert the value amount from `azeta` to ZETA, divide it by 10¹⁸. In the
example above the balance is 10 ZETA.

## Wrapped ZETA on ZetaChain

ZETA can exist on ZetaChain in a wrapped form as a
[WETH9 token](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/zevm/WZETA.sol).
When wrapping a token (in this example, ZETA) it is locked in a smart contract
and an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens (WZETA) is minted. The wrapped token
is pegged 1:1 to the native token and can be redeemed for the native token at
any time. WZETA is ERC-20 compatible, so it may be used or required by other
dApps that are built to interface with ERC-20 tokens. WZETA is WZETA is
primarily used in internal liquidity pools on ZetaChain paired with native gas
tokens of connected blockchains (for example, sETH/WZETA pair).

To wrap native ZETA and turn it into WZETA, send it to or use the `deposit`
method of the `zetaToken` [contract on ZetaChain](/reference/network/contracts).

## ZETA on Connected Blockchains

ZETA tokens on EVM-compatible connected blockchains (like Ethereum, Polygon and
BSC) are implemented as
[ERC-20](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/contracts/evm/Zeta.eth.sol)
tokens. You can find the contract addresses of the `zetaToken` on a connected
blockchain on the [contracts page](/reference/network/contracts).
