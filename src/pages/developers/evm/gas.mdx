## Calling Universal Apps

When interacting with a universal app on ZetaChain from a connected chain
through the Gateway, fees are paid in the native gas token of the source chain,
just like in standard transactions. There are no additional charges or fees, and
execution of universal apps on ZetaChain can be considered gasless, when a call
is made from a connected chain.

For instance, depositing ETH from Ethereum to ZetaChain incurs a fee in ETH,
aligning with Ethereum's usual gas fee structure. For detailed information on
Ethereum gas, refer to the [official
documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/).

Direct calls to contracts on ZetaChain's EVM (not cross-chain calls) require
users to provide gas fees for each transaction. The ZetaChain EVM employs a gas
market mechanism inspired by
[Ethermint](https://docs.ethermint.zone/basics/gas.html) and adheres to
Ethereum's EIP 1559 fee model, which helps maintain network security and
prevents spam.

## Outgoing Calls and Withdrawals

Universal apps on ZetaChain can initiate calls to contracts on connected chains
or facilitate withdrawals of ZRC-20 tokens back to a connected chain. These
operations require a "withdraw gas fee," which is calculated based on the gas
limit of the target chain.

Before making a call from a universal app to a contract on a connected chain,
query the withdraw gas fee for the expected gas limit:

```solidity
(address gasZRC20, uint256 gasFee) = IZRC20(zrc20).withdrawGasFeeWithGasLimit(gasLimit);
```

- `gasZRC20` is the address of the gas token for the destination chain of the
  call or withdrawal. For example, both for Ethereum USDC and ETH the gas token
  is ZRC-20 ETH.
- `gasFee` is the required amount for the specified gas limit. This ensures you
  can accurately estimate the necessary fees for successful execution.

Before withdrawing ZRC-20 tokens to a connected chain, query the withdraw gas
fee:

```solidity
(address gasZRC20, uint256 gasFee) = IZRC20(zrc20).withdrawGasFee();
```

Withdrawals to connected chains result in token transfers and do not require an
explicit gas limit.

Itâ€™s important to query the current gas fee, approve the Gateway to spend the
necessary amount, and ensure the gas ZRC-20 token balance is sufficient. If the
Gateway cannot transfer the required fee to itself, the operation will fail.

## Current Fees

The table below displays the current withdraw gas fees, calculated using a
default gas limit of 500,000. Fees are represented in the native gas token of
the destination chain.
