title: Gas Fees

import { Fees } from "~/components/Docs";

## Overview

When interacting with smart contracts on ZetaChain, users need to include a fee
for gas for each transaction.

The gas market mechanism for smart contracts on ZetaChain's EVM is similar to
that of [Ethermint](https://docs.ethermint.zone/basics/gas.html) and follows
Ethereum's EIP 1559 gas fee structure. This system is designed to deter spamming
activities on the network.

## Deposit

When depositing tokens to ZetaChain by sending them to the TSS (Threshold
Signature Scheme) address on a connected chain, you will pay the fee in the
native gas token of that chain, similar to a standard transaction.

For example, if you are depositing ETH from Ethereum to ZetaChain, the fee will
be in ETH, comparable to a regular token transfer on the Ethereum network. For
more information on Ethereum gas and fees, refer to the [official
documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/).

## Withdraw

When withdrawing ZRC-20 tokens back to a connected connected chain, the
"withdraw gas fee" is applicable (listed as "Total fee" in the table below).

To find out the fee amount, call the `withdrawGasFee` function on the [ZRC-20
contract](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/main/v2/contracts/zevm/ZRC20.sol)
for the token you wish to withdraw. This function will return the fee in the
native gas token of the connected chain.

The `withdraw` function will deduct this gas fee from your ZRC-20 balance and
proceed with the withdrawal to the destination chain.

## Current omnichain fees

In the table below you can see the current fees. The fees are defined in native
gas tokens on the destination chain (the chain to which ZRC-20 tokens are
withdrawn). The fees are calculated with the gas limit of 500000.

To calculate fees for a different gas limit, please, check out the `fees`
command in the smart-contract
[template](https://github.com/zeta-chain/template):
