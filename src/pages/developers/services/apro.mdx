## Overview

[APRO Oracle](https://apro.com/) combines off-chain processing with on-chain
verification to provide reliable price feeds and data services. The platform
supports multiple price feeds across various blockchain networks through two
service models:

- **Data Push**: Decentralized node operators push data updates to the
  blockchain based on price thresholds or time intervals, improving scalability
  and providing timely updates
- **Data Pull**: On-demand data access with high-frequency updates and low
  latency, ideal for DeFi protocols and DEXs requiring rapid data without
  ongoing on-chain costs

For contract addresses and supported price feeds, see the [price feed contract
documentation](https://docs.apro.com/en/data-push/price-feed-contract).
