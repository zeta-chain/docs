title: "SubQuery Indexer"
---

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer empowering developers with fast, flexible, and universal decentralised APIs for their web3 projects. With the SubQuery SDK, developers can access rich indexed data and create immersive decentralised applications with efficiency and speed. SubQuery supports numerous ecosystems including ZetaChain, Ethereum, Cosmos, Near, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, and more.

One of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data across multiple blockchains within a single project. This allows for the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multichain block scanners, not just within a single chain but across various blockchains.

Superior performance is guaranteed with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities, and a customisable caching architecture. To learn more, explore the comprehensive [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/).

## Running and Hosting ZetaChain SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is committed to open-source principles, offering the flexibility to run it in three ways:

- Locally (or a cloud provider). Refer to the [instructions](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html) on how to set this up.
- Utilise enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/), where the project is hosted with production-ready services, ensuring zero-downtime blue/green deployments and a generous free tier. Discover [how to get started](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).
- Publish it to the [decentralised network](https://subquery.network/network), the ultimate data service for dApp developers, combining openness, performance, reliability, and scalability. SubQuery Network indexes and delivers data to the global community in a verifiable and incentivised manner and has supported ZetaChain from launch.
