import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

## Overview

[Pyth Network](https://docs.pyth.network/) is a price oracle that provides a
high-frequency, low-latency price feed for a wide range of assets. It is
designed to be used by high-frequency trading systems and other applications
that require a high degree of accuracy and reliability.

Pyth is deployed on ZetaChain and provides price feeds for a wide range of
assets, including cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and equity.

Pyth Network is a permissionless system, meaning that anyone can submit prices
to the oracle. The system uses a decentralized consensus mechanism to ensure
that the prices are accurate and reliable.

The ZetaChain contributor team runs a Pyth scheduler that submits prices to the
Pyth oracle. The scheduler regularly updates the prices of assets on the oracle,
ensuring that the price feeds are accurate and up-to-date.

<Alert variant="warning">
  ZetaChain's Pyth scheduler is provided as a public service to the community to enhance the developer experience and
  make it easier to test out dapps. If you're building a production level dapp, you should **consider running your own
  scheduler**. Learn more in [the Pyth's
  docs](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/schedule-price-updates/using-scheduler).

Currently supported assets: BTC, BNB, MATIC, ETH, USDC, ZETA, USDT.

## Pyth Entropy

[Pyth Entropy](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy) allows developers to quickly and easily generate secure
random numbers on the blockchain. Entropy's rapid response time allows
developers to build applications such as NFT mints and games with responsive UX.
Entropy also provides strong security guarantees to ensure that both
users and application developers can trust that the results are random.

Pyth Entropy is currently available on Zetachain. [Learn more](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/generate-random-numbers) on how to generate a random number through Entropy.
