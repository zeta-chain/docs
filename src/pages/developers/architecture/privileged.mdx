title: Privileged Actions

import { AdminPolicy } from "~/components/Docs";

Certain privileged actions (transaction messages) are only allowed to be
performed by authorized entities. Some messages require the sender to be an
observer validator, while others require the sender to be a specific policy
account.

A policy account is similar to an on-chain multisig account with members voting
for message execution.

Each group has an admin, a set of members, and a set of policy accounts. Each
policy account has an admin, an address and a decision policy (threshold of
votes, voting period, etc.).

The group mechanism on ZetaChain is powered by the [`group` Cosmos SDK
module](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/group/).

ZetaChain can have any number of groups. Anyone can create a group. In this
document we only consider policy accounts that give authorization to perform
privileged actions.

These "special" policy accounts are defined in the [params of of the observer
module](https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/zeta-chain/observer/params).
These policy accounts are set during genesis and as any module parameter they
can be changed through governance. This is important, because even though the
protocol has a notion of admins and privileged policy accounts, they are chosen
by the community of the chain through governance. If a group/policy admin or
members of a group become malicious, the community can create a new group with
new admin and members and use the parameter change governance proposal to point
the parameter of the observer module to the new policy accounts.

To learn which policy accounts can send which privileged messages, check the
module documentation and look for "Authorized" notice next to each message.

  Notice that policy accounts below are called "Group1" and "Group2". These are just names that indicate the level of permissions
  and are not related to the actual groups associated with policy accounts. As you can see in testnet there are two entries
  ("Group1" and "Group2") and both point to the same policy account. This means that right now even though there are two
  levels of permissions ("Group1" and "Group2") there is only one policy account that is authorized to perform privileged
  actions. On mainnet this might change.{" "}
