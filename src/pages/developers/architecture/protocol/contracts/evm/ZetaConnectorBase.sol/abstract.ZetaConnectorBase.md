Abstract base contract for ZetaConnector.

*This contract implements basic functionality for handling tokens and interacting with the Gateway contract.*


## State Variables
### gateway
The Gateway contract used for executing cross-chain calls.


```solidity
IGatewayEVM public immutable gateway;
```


### zetaToken
The address of the Zeta token.


```solidity
address public immutable zetaToken;
```


### WITHDRAWER_ROLE
New role identifier for withdrawer role.


```solidity
bytes32 public constant WITHDRAWER_ROLE = keccak256("WITHDRAWER_ROLE");
```


### PAUSER_ROLE
New role identifier for pauser role.


```solidity
bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE");
```


### TSS_ROLE
New role identifier for tss role.


```solidity
bytes32 public constant TSS_ROLE = keccak256("TSS_ROLE");
```


## Functions
### constructor

Constructor for ZetaConnectors.

*Set admin as default admin and pauser, and tssAddress as tss role.*


```solidity
constructor(address gateway_, address zetaToken_, address tssAddress_, address admin_);
```

### pause

Pause contract.


```solidity
function pause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE);
```

### unpause

Unpause contract.


```solidity
function unpause() external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE);
```

### withdraw

Withdraw tokens to a specified address.


```solidity
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 internalSendHash) external virtual;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The address to withdraw tokens to.|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of tokens to withdraw.|
|`internalSendHash`|`bytes32`|A hash used for internal tracking of the transaction.|


### withdrawAndCall

Withdraw tokens and call a contract through Gateway.


```solidity
function withdrawAndCall(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data, bytes32 internalSendHash) external virtual;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The address to withdraw tokens to.|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of tokens to withdraw.|
|`data`|`bytes`|The calldata to pass to the contract call.|
|`internalSendHash`|`bytes32`|A hash used for internal tracking of the transaction.|


### withdrawAndRevert

Withdraw tokens and call a contract with a revert callback through Gateway.


```solidity
function withdrawAndRevert(
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data,
    bytes32 internalSendHash,
    RevertContext calldata revertContext
)
    external
    virtual;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`to`|`address`|The address to withdraw tokens to.|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of tokens to withdraw.|
|`data`|`bytes`|The calldata to pass to the contract call.|
|`internalSendHash`|`bytes32`|A hash used for internal tracking of the transaction.|
|`revertContext`|`RevertContext`|Revert context to pass to onRevert.|


### receiveTokens

Handle received tokens.


```solidity
function receiveTokens(uint256 amount) external virtual;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of tokens received.|


## Errors
### ZeroAddress
Error indicating that a zero address was provided.


```solidity
error ZeroAddress();
```
