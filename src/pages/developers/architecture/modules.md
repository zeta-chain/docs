## crosschain

### Overview

The `crosschain` module tracks inbound and outbound cross-chain transactions
(CCTX).

The main actors interacting with the Crosschain module are observer validators
(or "observers"). Observers are running an off-chain program (called
`zetaclient`) that watches connected blockchains for inbound transactions and
watches ZetaChain for pending outbound transactions and watches connected chains
for outbound transactions.

After observing an inbound or an outbound transaction, an observer participates
in a voting process.

#### Voting

When an observer submits a vote for a transaction a `ballot` is created (if it
wasn't created before). Observers are allowed to cast votes that will be
associated with this ballot. Based on `BallotThreshold`, when enough votes are
cast ballot is considered to be "finalized".

The last vote that moves the ballot to the "finalized" state triggers execution
and pays the gas costs of the cross-chain transaction.

Any votes cast after the ballot has been finalized are discarded.

#### Inbound Transaction

Inbound transactions are cross-chain transactions observed on connected chains.
To vote on an inbound transaction an observer broadcasts `MsgVoteInbound`.

The last vote that moves the ballot to the "finalized" state triggers execution
of the cross-chain transaction.

If the destination chain is ZetaChain and the CCTX does not contain a message,
ZRC20 tokens are deposited into an account on ZetaChain.

If the destination chain is ZetaChain and the CCTX contains a message, ZRC20
tokens are deposited and a contract on ZetaChain is called. Contract address and
the arguments for the contract call are contained within the message.

If the destination chain is not ZetaChain, the status of a transaction is
changed to "pending outbound" and the CCTX to be processed as an outbound
transaction.

#### Outbound Transaction

###### Pending Outbound

Observers watch ZetaChain for pending outbound transactions. To process a
pending outbound transactions observers enter into a TSS keysign ceremony to
sign the transaction, and then broadcast the signed transaction to the connected
blockchains.

###### Observed Outbound

Observers watch connected blockchains for the broadcasted outbound transactions.
Once a transaction is "confirmed" (or "mined") on a connected blockchains,
observers vote on ZetaChain by sending a `VoteOutbound` message.

After the vote passes the threshold, the voting is finalized and a transaction's
status is changed to final.

### Messages

#### MsgAddOutboundTracker

AddOutboundTracker adds a new record to the outbound transaction tracker.
only the admin policy account and the observer validators are authorized to broadcast this message without proof.
If no pending cctx is found, the tracker is removed, if there is an existed tracker with the nonce & chainID.

```proto
message MsgAddOutboundTracker {
	string creator = 1;
	int64 chain_id = 2;
	uint64 nonce = 3;
	string tx_hash = 4;
	pkg.proofs.Proof proof = 5;
	string block_hash = 6;
	int64 tx_index = 7;
}
```

#### MsgAddInboundTracker

AddInboundTracker adds a new record to the inbound transaction tracker.

```proto
message MsgAddInboundTracker {
	string creator = 1;
	int64 chain_id = 2;
	string tx_hash = 3;
	pkg.coin.CoinType coin_type = 4;
	pkg.proofs.Proof proof = 5;
	string block_hash = 6;
	int64 tx_index = 7;
}
```

#### MsgRemoveInboundTracker

RemoveInboundTracker removes the inbound tracker if it exists.

```proto
message MsgRemoveInboundTracker {
	string creator = 1;
	int64 chain_id = 2;
	string tx_hash = 3;
}
```

#### MsgRemoveOutboundTracker

RemoveOutboundTracker removes a record from the outbound transaction tracker by chain ID and nonce.

Authorized: admin policy group 1.

```proto
message MsgRemoveOutboundTracker {
	string creator = 1;
	int64 chain_id = 2;
	uint64 nonce = 3;
}
```

#### MsgVoteGasPrice

VoteGasPrice submits information about the connected chain's gas price at a specific block
height. Gas price submitted by each validator is recorded separately and a
median index is updated.

Only observer validators are authorized to broadcast this message.

```proto
message MsgVoteGasPrice {
	string creator = 1;
	int64 chain_id = 2;
	uint64 price = 3;
	uint64 priority_fee = 6;
	uint64 block_number = 4;
	string supply = 5;
}
```

#### MsgVoteOutbound

VoteOutbound casts a vote on an outbound transaction observed on a connected chain (after
it has been broadcasted to and finalized on a connected chain). If this is
the first vote, a new ballot is created. When a threshold of votes is
reached, the ballot is finalized. When a ballot is finalized, the outbound
transaction is processed.

If the observation is successful, the difference between zeta burned
and minted is minted by the bank module and deposited into the module
account.

If the observation is unsuccessful, the logic depends on the previous
status.

If the previous status was `PendingOutbound`, a new revert transaction is
created. To cover the revert transaction fee, the required amount of tokens
submitted with the CCTX are swapped using a Uniswap V2 contract instance on
ZetaChain for the ZRC20 of the gas token of the receiver chain. The ZRC20
tokens are then
burned. The nonce is updated. If everything is successful, the CCTX status is
changed to `PendingRevert`.

If the previous status was `PendingRevert`, the CCTX is aborted.

	pkg.coin.CoinType coin_type = 9;
	ConfirmationMode confirmation_mode = 13;
}
```

#### MsgVoteInbound

VoteInbound casts a vote on an inbound transaction observed on a connected chain. If this
is the first vote, a new ballot is created. When a threshold of votes is
reached, the ballot is finalized. When a ballot is finalized, a new CCTX is
created.

If the receiver chain is ZetaChain, `HandleEVMDeposit` is called. If the
tokens being deposited are ZETA, `MintZetaToEVMAccount` is called and the
tokens are minted to the receiver account on ZetaChain. If the tokens being
deposited are gas tokens or ERC20 of a connected chain, ZRC20's `deposit`
method is called and the tokens are deposited to the receiver account on
ZetaChain. If the message is not empty, system contract's `depositAndCall`
method is also called and an omnichain contract on ZetaChain is executed.
Omnichain contract address and arguments are passed as part of the message.
If everything is successful, the CCTX status is changed to `OutboundMined`.

If the receiver chain is a connected chain, the `FinalizeInbound` method is
called to prepare the CCTX to be processed as an outbound transaction. To
cover the outbound transaction fee, the required amount of tokens submitted
with the CCTX are swapped using a Uniswap V2 contract instance on ZetaChain
for the ZRC20 of the gas token of the receiver chain. The ZRC20 tokens are
then burned. The nonce is updated. If everything is successful, the CCTX
status is changed to `PendingOutbound`.

## emissions

### Overview

The `emissions` module is responsible for orchestrating rewards distribution for
observers, validators and TSS signers. Currently, it only distributes rewards to
validators every block. The undistributed amount for TSS and observers is stored
in their respective pools.

The distribution of rewards is implemented in the begin blocker.

The module keeps track of parameters used for calculating rewards:

- Maximum bond factor
- Minimum bond factor
- Average block time
- Target bond ratio
- Validator emission percentage
- Observer emission percentage
- TSS Signer emission percentage
- Duration factor constant

### Messages

#### MsgUpdateParams

if the pool does not have enough balance to process this request, an error is returned.

```proto
message MsgWithdrawEmission {

## fungible

### Overview

The `fungible` module facilitates the deployment of fungible tokens of connected
blockchains (called "foreign coins") on ZetaChain.

Foreign coins are represented as ZRC20 tokens on ZetaChain.

When a foreign coin is deployed on ZetaChain, a ZRC20 contract is deployed, a
pool is created, liquidity is added to the pool, and the foreign coin is added
to the list of foreign coins in the module's state.

The module contains the logic for:

- Deploying a foreign coin on ZetaChain
- Deploying a system contract, Uniswap and wrapped ZETA
- Depositing to and calling omnichain smart contracts on ZetaChain from
  connected chains (`DepositZRC20AndCallContract` and `DepositZRC20`)

the module depends heavily on the [protocol
contracts](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts).

#### State

The `fungible` module keeps track of the following state:

- System contract address
- A list of foreign coins

## observer

### Overview

The `observer` module keeps track of ballots for voting, a mapping between
chains and observer accounts, a list of supported connected chains, core
parameters (contract addresses, outbound transaction schedule interval, etc.),
observer parameters (ballot threshold, min observer delegation, etc.), and admin
policy parameters.

Ballots are used to vote on inbound and outbound transaction. The `observer`
module keeps create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for ballots, as
well as helper functions to determine if a ballot has been finalized. The ballot
system is used by other modules, such as the `crosschain` module when observer
validators vote on transactions.

An observer validator is a validator that runs `zetaclient` alongside the
`zetacored` (the blockchain node) and is authorized to vote on inbound and
outbound cross-chain transactions.

A mapping between chains and observer accounts right now is set during genesis
and is used in the `crosschain` module to determine whether an observer
validator is authorized to vote on a transaction coming in/out of a specific
connected chain.
