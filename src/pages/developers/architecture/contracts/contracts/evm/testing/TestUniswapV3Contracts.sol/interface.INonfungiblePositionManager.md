[Git Source](https://github.com/zeta-chain/protocol-contracts/blob/211e1d1303ec9b17c54dd015449852d1d240bf4f/contracts/evm/testing/TestUniswapV3Contracts.sol)

Wraps Uniswap V3 positions in a non-fungible token interface which allows for them to be transferred
and authorized.


## Functions
### positions

Returns the position information associated with a given token ID.

*Throws if the token ID is not valid.*


```solidity
function positions(uint256 tokenId)
    external
    view
    returns (
        uint96 nonce,
        address operator,
        address token0,
        address token1,
        uint24 fee,
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 liquidity,
        uint256 feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
        uint256 feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
        uint128 tokensOwed0,
        uint128 tokensOwed1
    );
```

### mint

Creates a new position wrapped in a NFT

*Call this when the pool does exist and is initialized. Note that if the pool is created but not initialized
a method does not exist, i.e. the pool is assumed to be initialized.*


```solidity

|`liquidity`|`uint128`|The amount of liquidity for this position|
|`amount0`|`uint256`|The amount of token0|
|`amount1`|`uint256`|The amount of token1|


### increaseLiquidity

Increases the amount of liquidity in a position, with tokens paid by the `msg.sender`


```solidity
function increaseLiquidity(IncreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)
    external

|----|----|-----------|
|`liquidity`|`uint128`|The new liquidity amount as a result of the increase|

### decreaseLiquidity

Decreases the amount of liquidity in a position and accounts it to the position


```solidity
function decreaseLiquidity(DecreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)

```
**Parameters**

### Collect
Emitted when tokens are collected for a position NFT
