title: ERC-20 on ZetaChain
---

import { Alert } from "~/components/shared";

ZetaChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and
[ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20) token
contracts can be deployed to ZetaChain permissionlessly.

<Alert variant="note"> An ERC-20 token deployed to ZetaChain **does not** have
  the properties of [ZRC-20](/developers/tokens/zrc20), specifically, it can't
  be withdrawn from ZetaChain to a connected chain. </Alert>

If a specific ERC-20 token on a connected chain is not a supported ZRC-20, you
can still transfer this ERC-20 to and from a universal app using the connector
API. Check out the [ERC-20 tutorial](/developers/tutorials/erc20) to learn more.
