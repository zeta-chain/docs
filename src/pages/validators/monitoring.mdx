## Prerequisites

First install [Grafana](https://grafana.com) and
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) on your machine.

## Enable tendermint metrics

To enable metrics, you'll have to make an adjustment in the node's `config.toml`
file by setting the `prometheus` option to `true`:

```bash
sed -i 's/prometheus = false/prometheus = true/g' /home/zetachain/.zetacored/config/config.toml
```

To apply the modification, it's necessary to restart the node. You should then
have the capability to reach the `tendermint` metrics, which are set as the
default on port port **26660**: [http://localhost:26660](http://localhost:26660)

## Configure prometheus targets

Locate the `prometheus.yml` file and add the following `job` entry under the
`scrape_configs` section:

```yaml
- job_name: "zetachain"
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:26660"]
      labels:
        instance: "validator"
```

On Linux machines, you can typically find the `prometheus.yml` file at the
following path: `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

## Reload Prometheus and Restart Zetachain

Reload **Prometheus** configuration:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
```

Restart **Zetachain** Node:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart zetacored
```

## Configure Grafana

By default, Grafana usually runs on port 3000. You can access Grafana by
navigating to the following URL: `http://localhost:3000`.

The default username and password is `admin`.

Add your Prometheus Data Source:

![Grafana Config](/img/docs/grafana-config.png)

Click on `Save & test` to test the configuration, if everything is alright
you'll see the green message **Data source is working**.

## Import grafana dashboard

Copy and paste the
[Grafana Dashboard ID](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11036) `11036` and
click on `Load` to complete importing.

Select your Prometheus as Data Source and click **Import**.

At this point, you should be able to monitor your validator node.
