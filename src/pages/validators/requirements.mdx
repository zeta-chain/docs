# Technical Requirements

## Node Specifications

These are the recommended specs for a ZetaChain node.

| Node Type       | CPU    | Memory       | Data Disk         |
| :-------------- | :----- | :----------- | :---------------- |
| Observer Signer | 8 CPUs | 32 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |
| Core Validator  | 4 CPUs | 16 GB Memory | 300+ GB Data Disk |

It is recommended to run a validator on a machine with NVMe SSDs that support
high IOPS (12K or higher).

## Network Requirements

### Public Ports

ZetaChain nodes communicate over the following ports. Make sure these are open
to the public internet.

| Node Type               | Port  | Protocol |
| :---------------------- | :---- | :------- |
| Full Node and Validator | 26656 | TCP      |
| Observer Signer Only    | 8123  | TCP      |
| Observer Signer Only    | 6668  | TCP      |

Additionally, Observer Signers must allow communication between `zetacored` and
`zetaclientd` on port 9090 but this port should not be publicly accessible.

### RPC/API/Archive Nodes

If you want to access RPC/API services on your node you'll need to make sure the
following ports are open.

| RPC Type       | Port | Protocol |
| :------------- | :--- | :------- |
| EVM RPC - HTTP | 8545 | TCP      |
| EVM RPC - WSS  | 8546 | TCP      |
| Cosmos RPC     | 1317 | TCP      |

### Operating System

ZetaChain nodes have been developed and tested on x86_64 architecture. Our
binary files have been compiled with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. This guide assumes
you are using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x86_64. If you are using a different OS you may
need to make some adjustments.
