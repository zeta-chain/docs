title: What is ZetaChain?
description: Description

Our mission is to build a Universal Blockchain with native access to any
blockchain, making crypto as accessible, diverse, and connected as the internet.

## The Future We See

The blockchain revolution promised a new digital frontier â€“ open, borderless,
and controlled by its users. Yet today, we face a fractured landscape of
isolated ecosystems, where innovation is constrained by technical boundaries and
users are trapped in digital silos. This fragmentation threatens the very
promise of decentralization.

At ZetaChain, we envision a future where blockchain technology fulfills its
original promise of openness and innovation without borders. By building a
Universal Blockchain, we aim to become the Universal Entrypoint to the
decentralized world, unlocking true connectivity and freedom for all.

## Universal Blockchain

ZetaChain is the first ever Universal Blockchain to enable native connection
across all blockchain ecosystems.

Zetachain brings programmability to non-smart contract chains such as Bitcoin
and Dogecoin, opening up unprecedented possibilities for developers to create
truly interoperable applications without sacrificing security or user
experience.

### Universal PoS

ZetaChain's Proof of Stake system, built on Cosmos SDK and Comet BFT, secures
efficient cross-chain operations with:

- 5-Second Finality
- Core Validators and Observer-Signer Validators to ensure network and
  cross-chain security
- Incentive mechanisms that prioritize security across all connected chains

### Universal EVM

Universal EVM is an execution environment that can be called from any chain,
allowing developers to:

- Manage and interact with native assets, contracts, and wallets across
  connected chains
- Create applications with built-in cross-chain capabilities within a familiar
  EVM environment

### Universal Smart Contract

Universal Smart Contract is deployed natively on ZetaChain and can read and
write to any connected chains. It streamlines cross-chain development by:

- Orchestrating complex multi-chain actions
- Accessing liquidity across different networks
- Delivering unified, cross-chain user experiences
- Extending functionality with additional chain-specific contracts when needed

## Solutions

### Bitcoin: Unlocking New Possibilities

ZetaChain brings programmability to Bitcoin, enabling native DeFi interactions
without intermediaries. Developers can create new yield opportunities for
Bitcoin and bring Bitcoin in the broader crypto economy securely.

### DeFi: Unifying Multi-Chain Liquidity

ZetaChain forms a unified liquidity and execution hub for DeFi applications to
build across different networks effortlessly: DEXs, yield aggregators,
stablecoins, money markets, and more.

### Social, Gaming, NFT: Universal Digital Ownership

Mint, trade, and manage digital assets and data across any blockchain
ecosystems, enabling simple interoperability and interactions for creators,
collectors, and players.

### Infrastructure: Institutional-Grade Credibility

Built on a decentralized, secure foundation and supported by industry-leading
validators, ZetaChain provides an institutional-grade platform for Universal
Solutions.
