Voting on proposals is an important part of participating in the governance of ZetaChain, allowing you to have a say in the future direction and decisions of the network. Your vote matters, and this guide will help you navigate the voting process using Keplr extension.

Proposals can have three statuses: "Passed", "Rejected", and "Voting". To view only the proposals that are currently open for voting, select "Voting Period" from the filter box in the upper right corner of the proposals list.

Click on the proposal you are interested in to view its details.

Once you are on the proposal details page, you can read the full description of the proposal, including its goals, potential impacts, and any additional information provided by the proposer. After reviewing the proposal, you will see options to cast your vote.

To vote:

- Click the "Vote" button in the upper right corner.
- Select your voting option (e.g., Yes, No, No with Veto, Abstain).
    - Yes: Support the proposal.
    - No: Oppose the proposal.
    - No with Veto: Strongly oppose the proposal and believe it is harmful; can lead to a veto if a significant portion of votes are "No with Veto".
    - Abstain: Neutral stance; neither supports nor opposes the proposal but contributes to the voting process.
- Click the "Confirm" button.
- Approve the transaction in your Keplr extension to submit your vote.

After voting, you can monitor the status of the proposal and see the results once the voting period ends. Staying engaged with the governance process helps ensure that the decisions made reflect the collective will of the ZetaChain community.
