Next, select the asset you want to transfer. Note, that Keplr will only show
native and IBC tokens, but not ZRC-20 or ERC-20. Select ZETA from the list:

Enter the recipient address in the bech32 format (`zeta***`) and the amount you
want to transfer. Please, note that the amount in Keplr is specified in ZETA, so
in this example you're sending 1 ZETA or 10ยนโธ azeta. You can also add a memo.
Memo is optional and is often used when sending tokens to centralized exchanges.

Click "Next" to review the transaction details:
