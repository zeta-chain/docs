Select the validator you wish to stake with and click on it. This will display some basic information about the chosen validator on the right side of the screen:

Return to the Staked interface in Keplr, and you will see the amount of ZETA you just staked along with your rewards.

By following these steps, you can successfully stake your ZETA tokens using the Keplr extension and participate in the network's validation process. Staking helps secure the network and can provide you with staking rewards.
