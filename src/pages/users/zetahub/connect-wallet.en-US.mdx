title: Connect a Wallet in ZetaHub
---

When you enter ZetaHub, you will be prompted to connect your wallet during the
onboarding steps.

If you decide not to connect your wallet here, you will be able to connect your
wallet on most other ZetaHub pages before interacting with them by clicking on
any “Connect Wallet” button. There is also a “Connect Wallet” button on the
upper right side of the screen.

When you click on any “Connect Wallet” button, the above modal will appear.

You will have to have an existing account on the above EVM-compatible wallets -
if you don’t have one, you will be able to follow the onscreen instructions to
create one.

If you have an existing account, you will be prompted to log in.

If at any point you’d like to switch wallets, you can click the wallet dropdown
on the top right. This will take you to a new modal - where you can hit
“Disconnect” and follow the previous instructions to connect a different wallet.
