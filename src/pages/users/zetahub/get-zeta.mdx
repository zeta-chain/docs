In order to get more ZETA, you can head to the top navigation in ZetaHub and
select “Get ZETA”.

![Get ZETA](/img/docs/zetahub/get-zeta-1.png)

This will open up a modal where you can select an exchange from which you will
be able to get ZETA. Once you decide on where you’d like to go, an external site
will open, and you will be able to follow the CEX/DEX’s instructions on how to
proceed.

You will also be able to access this modal within most ZetaHub pages where
having a ZETA balance is necessary to transact. If you don’t have sufficient
balance, you will come across a button that prompts you to “Get ZETA.”
