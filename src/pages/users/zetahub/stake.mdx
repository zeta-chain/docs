title: Delegate/Stake ZETA
---

ZetaHub offers an easy-to-use interface for staking ZETA tokens and claiming
staking rewards. Staking involves delegating your tokens to validators who help
secure the ZetaChain network by processing transactions and maintaining the
blockchain. By staking your ZETA tokens, you contribute to the network's
security and decentralization while earning rewards. This guide will walk you
through the key steps, from choosing a validator to claiming rewards and
managing your delegations.

At the top of the screen, you can see the amount staked, the amount available to
stake, and the amount available to claim.

Below, there is a table of ZetaChain validators with information such as voting
power, commission, uptime, and status.

## Stake

To stake ZETA tokens, select a validator from the table and click "Stake".

When staking, it's important to consider:

- Voting Power: Voting power does not affect staking rewards. Itâ€™s advisable to
  delegate to validators who are not in the top 10 based on voting power to help
  decentralize the network.

- Commission Rates: Some validators have a 100% commission rate, meaning all
  rewards go to the validator, not the delegators. Validators may do this to
  discourage delegations.

Enter the amount you want to delegate and press "Stake".

After confirming the transaction in your wallet, a notification will indicate
that the delegation was successful.

At the top of the page, you can now see all the validators you have delegated
to.

Once the redelegation transaction is processed successfully, the new validator
will appear in your list. Note that redelegation happens immediately after the
transaction is confirmed.

After the unbonding period is over, the unstaking process will be complete, and
the unstaked tokens will be available in your wallet. Please note that the
duration of the unbonding period may vary.
