Zeta XP is ZetaHub’s way to track your activity on the app. To participate in
the XP program and be able to earn XP for your ZetaHub actions, you will have to
first enroll. There are two ways to do so:

Enroll: When you enter the Earn XP page, you will see an onboarding screen. From
there, you will be prompted to enroll. Just enrolling in XP will boost you 1000
XP to start!

Accept Invite: Another way to enroll in XP is to accept an invite from an
existing user of Zeta XP. If you receive an invite link from a friend (please
ensure the link is the real https://hub.zetachain.com domain), you will be able
to earn double the XP (2000 XP!) for accepting the invite and enrolling.

Accepting an invite without ZETA balance: If you try to accept an invite without
an existing ZETA balance, you will have to get a small amount before you’re able
to accept and enroll in XP. The window will direct you to a modal which will
direct you to sources you can you can get ZETA from.
