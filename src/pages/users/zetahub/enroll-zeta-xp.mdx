ZetaHub XP program offers an opportunity to engage with and explore the
ZetaChain ecosystem. This program allows you to earn experience points (XP) by
performing activities on ZetaChain, enabling you to level up and unlock rewards.
These rewards can be used for future perks, live events, and other app-based
incentives.

## Enroll in XP

The XP is tracked on chain, so you will be prompted to sign a transaction to
enroll in the program. Don't worry, you can get some ZETA for transaction fees
using the Fuel program. Confirm the transaction in your wallet:

Once you have joined the XP program, you will see your initial Status tier.
Users start at the Silver level and can progress through Rose Gold, Black, and
finally Green, which is currently the highest level. These XP Status tiers help
apps assign perks and rewards to real and valuable users, determining
eligibility for specific rewards. It's important to note that the ranking system
may change periodically based on community feedback and ecosystem needs.

On this page, you can track your XP progress and see how close you are to
reaching the next tier.

To maintain an "Active" status each week, a you must meet a minimum active
threshold of XP. This requirement encourages consistent engagement and provides
apps with greater confidence when designing rewards. Certain rewards may only be
available to users who are enrolled, active, and/or have maintained a minimum
active streak, adding an extra dimension to the XP tracking system.
