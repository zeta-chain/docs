Once you have joined the XP program, you will see your initial Status tier.
Users start at the Silver level and can progress through Rose Gold, Black, and
finally Green, which is currently the highest level. These XP Status tiers help
apps assign perks and rewards to real and valuable users, determining
eligibility for specific rewards. It's important to note that the ranking system
may change periodically based on community feedback and ecosystem needs.

On this page, you can track your XP progress and see how close you are to
reaching the next tier.

To maintain an "Active" status each week, you must meet a minimum active threshold of XP.
This requirement encourages consistent engagement and provides
apps with greater confidence when designing rewards. Certain rewards may only be
available to users who are enrolled, active, and/or have maintained a minimum
active streak, adding an extra dimension to the XP tracking system.
