title: Delegating to a Validator
---

## Prerequisites

This tutorial requires `zetacored` CLI to be installed. Please, check out the
docs [on installing the CLI](/users/cli/setup).

## Delegating to a Validator

ZetaChain is a proof of stake blockchain network. Validators are responsible for
producing new blocks and securing the network. You can delegate your ZETA to a
validator to participate in the network and earn rewards.

You can find a list of validators on
[ZetaScan](https://explorer.zetachain.com/validators), [Ping
Pub](https://ping.pub/zetachain/staking), or any [other
explorer](/about/services/).

Choose the validator you want to delegate to based on their commission rate,
uptime, how much voting power they have and other factors. It is generally a
good idea to NOT delegate to validators that have the most voting power, this
ensures that the network remains decentralized.

Copy the validator's operator address from the explorer. The address should be
prefixed with `zetavaloper`.

Next, check your [account balance](/users/cli/balances) and decide on the amount
you want to stake.

Before delegating itâ€™s important to understand that your ZETA will be locked for
a period of time. You will not be able to transfer or spend it. The amount of
time it is locked for depends on the network parameters. You can check the
parameters using the API:

https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network/lcd/v1/public/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/params

Run the following command to delegate your ZETA to the validator:

```
zetacored tx staking delegate zetavaloper167ns6zwczl9asjs47jwv3uhtkxfjcvx3fg3d4a 1000000000000000azeta --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public --from alice --chain-id athens_7001-1
```

- `zetavaloper167ns6zwczl9asjs47jwv3uhtkxfjcvx3fg3d4a` is the validator operator
  address
- `1000000000000000azeta` is the amount (in this example, 0.001 ZETA)
- `--node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public` is the
  Tendermint RPC URL
- `--from alice` is they account key name (see [Managing
  Accounts](/users/cli/account))
- `--chain-id athens_7001-1` is the chain ID of the ZetaChain testnet

The terminal will ask you to confirm the transaction:

```

    amount: []
    gas_limit: "200000"
    granter: ""
    payer: ""

```

Type `y` and press Enter to confirm.

```

```

The transaction was successful. You can check your balance again to see that the
amount has been deducted.

You can also confirm the transaction on the explorer by searching for the
transaction hash:
