title: Making a Deposit
---

## Overview

For a proposal to progress into the voting period, it must meet the minimum
deposit requirement. The min deposit amount is specified [parameters of
governance module](/users/cli/governance/). If the deposit amount is
less than the minimum required deposit amount, the proposal will enter the
"deposit period" and will wait for the required amount of tokens to be deposited
within the "max deposit period".

Any use can make a deposit to a proposal.

## Querying a proposal

Query a proposal by proposal ID to confirm that the proposal is in the deposit
period:

```
zetacored q gov proposal 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
deposit_end_time: "2024-02-14T02:18:32.334547494Z"
```

```yaml
deposit_end_time: "2024-02-14T02:18:32.334547494Z"
final_tally_result:
  abstain_count: "0"
  no_count: "0"
  no_with_veto_count: "0"
  yes_count: "0"
id: "58"
messages:

    content:
      "@type": /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal
      description: Description of the proposal
      title: Important Proposal
metadata: https://example.org/metadata.json
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD
submit_time: "2024-02-13T14:18:32.334547494Z"
total_deposit:
  - amount: "0"
    denom: azeta
voting_end_time: null
voting_start_time: null
```

You can see that the total deposit amount is 0. This means that the proposal is
in the deposit period and waiting for the required amount of tokens to be
deposited.

## Making a Deposit

Let's say the current "min deposit amount" value is 1000000azeta. You can make a
deposit to the proposal using the following command:

```
zetacored tx gov deposit 58 1000000azeta --from alice --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public --chain-id athens_7001-1
```

Once your transaction is successfully executed, you can query the proposal to
confirm that the deposit has been made:

```
zetacored q gov proposal 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
deposit_end_time: "2024-02-14T02:18:32.334547494Z"
```

```yaml
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD
total_deposit:
  - amount: "1001000"
    denom: azeta
```

You can see that the proposal is now in the voting period and the total deposit
amount is 1000000azeta. This means that the proposal has met the minimum
deposit.

## Querying Individual Deposits

You can query individual deposits to a proposal using the following command:

```
zetacored q gov deposits 58 --node https://zetachain-athens.blockpi.network:443/rpc/v1/public
```

```yaml
deposits:
  - amount:
      - amount: "1000000"
        denom: azeta
    depositor: zeta19nfaqu9wr0fktyyampva98ec025kjy0phww5um
    proposal_id: "58"
```
